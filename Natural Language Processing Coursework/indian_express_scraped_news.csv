"Stock Market Today: Sensex, Nifty decline 1% each on concerns over higher US deficit",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/india-stock-market-today-sensex-nifty-live-updates-10021212/,"Indian Stock Market Today:Domestic stock market indices, Sensex and Nifty, fell nearly one per cent on Friday as fears of higher fiscal deficit in the US and rising bond yields weighed on investor sentiment. The BSE‚Äôs Sensex fell 1.06 per cent to a low of 80,727.11, after opening at 81,323.05, compared to previous close of 81,596.63. The Nifty plunged 1.09 per cent to 24,541.6 in the morning session. The 50-share index opened at 24,733.95. ‚ÄúThere is slight risk off in global markets. This is evident from the strength in alternate assets like gold and Bitcoin. The fundamental issue is the high fiscal deficit of the US which the market feels is unsustainable. The weak US 20-year bond auction and the spike in yields of 5-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds indicate the declining confidence in US bonds,‚Äù said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. Last week,Moody‚Äôs Ratings downgraded the US government‚Äôs ratingby one notch, reflecting the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns. Analysts said that a spike in US bond yields also weighed on investor sentiments. ‚ÄúWall Street suffered steep losses during Wednesday‚Äôs session as multiple headwinds converged to weigh on investor sentiment. The major averages rebounded from initial declines but slumped back into negative territory as the day progressed, ending sharply lower despite recovering from their worst levels,‚Äù said Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities. The Dow plunged 816.80 points (1.9 per cent) to 41,860, while the S&P 500 dropped 95.85 points (1.6 per cent) to 5,844 and the Nasdaq tumbled 270.07 points (1.4 per cent) to 18,872. Bitcoin reached a record high, fuelled by growing optimism around U.S. cryptocurrency legislation. The surge followed increased bipartisan congressional support for stablecoin regulation, digital currencies pegged to the dollar. The Nifty Auto lost 1.26 per cent and Nifty IT fell 0.76 per cent. The NSE companies that lost the most included Power Grid Corporation (2.19 per cent), ITC ltd (1.65 per cent), Reliance Ltd (1.59 per cent) andTrent(1.58 per cent). All broader market indices fell, Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 declining 0.38 per cent and 0.2 per cent. In an unprecedented move, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Thursday revoked Harvard University‚Äôs certification to host international students, leaving nearly 7,000 students from across the globe in limbo and escalating an already bitter political clash between the Trump administration and the Ivy League giant."

Mach‚Äôs principle states that the mass of every object in the universe is affected by its interaction with every other object was central to the Hoyle-Narlikar gravity theory. 2. Einstein was greatly inspired by the principle and incorporated it into his theory. 3. The Hoyle-Narlikar theory of gravity proposed a ‚Äúcreation field‚Äù (C-field), a hypothetical negative-energy field responsible for the continuous creation of matter. Which of the statements given above is/are correct? (a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 only (c) 2 and 3 only (d) 1, 2 and 3 Explanation ‚Äî¬†Jayant Narlikar, an eminent Indian astronomer, science communicator, and Padma Vibhushan recipient, died at the age of 87. ‚Äî¬†He was best known for proposing the Hoyle-Narlikar theory of gravity (also known as conformal gravity), which he developed in 1964 with English astronomer and professor Fred Hoyle. The hypothesis intended to improve upon Albert Einstein‚Äôs General hypothesis of Relativity, which was published in 1915. ‚Äî Mach‚Äôs principle, which states that every object‚Äôs mass is changed by its interaction with every other object, is central to the Hoyle-Narlikar gravity theory. The notion profoundly intrigued Einstein,but he was unable to incorporate it into his theories.Hence, statement 1 is correct and statement 2 is not correct. ‚Äî The Hoyle-Narlikar gravity theory also proposed a ‚Äúcreation field‚Äù (C-field), which is a hypothetical negative-energy field that is responsible for the continual formation of matter. This helps to explain the steady-state cosmology, which holds that the universe has no beginning and would exist indefinitely.Hence, statement 3 is correct. ‚Äî¬†The Hoyle-Narlikar theory of gravity was not widely accepted, particularly following the discovery of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in 1965. The CMB, also known as an echo or shockwave of the Big Bang, is a cooled remnant of the first light to flow freely throughout the cosmos. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer. Which of the following missions of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) have failed? 1. EOS-07 mission 2. Inaugural flight in 1993 3. C-39 mission Select the correct answer using the codes given below: (a) 1 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 1 and 3 only (d) 3 only Explanation ‚Äî¬†TheIndian Space Research Organisation‚Äôs(ISRO) 101st satellite launch failed. The Earth observation satelliteEOS-09was aboard the PSLV-C61(Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle). ‚Äî¬†This was the 63rd PSLV launch. Since their introduction in the 1990s,PSLVs have only failed twice ‚Äì the first during the inaugural flight in 1993 and in 2017, when the C-39 mission was unsuccessful. Here is why PSLVs have become reliable for India‚Äôs Space agency and what happened during the two failed missions. ‚ÄîISROhas three types of launchers: the PSLV, the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk-III (LVM3). Variants are chosen based on the cargo weights and the orbit they will reach. ‚Äî¬†PSLV: Satellites used for navigation, mapping, or other functions must be transported into space by launch vehicles or rockets such as the PSLV. The rockets feature powerful propulsion systems that create massive amounts of energy, which is required to lift large things such as satellites into space while resisting the Earth‚Äôs gravitational pull. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer. With reference to the stars, consider the following statements: 1. Regardless of duration, all stars survive by maintaining a balance between two competing forces: the inward pull of gravity and the outward pressure produced by nuclear energy. 2. In the dense core of a star, nuclear fusion converts hydrogen into helium. 3. When a star‚Äôs fuel is exhausted, gravity takes over ‚Äî and then the nature of its death depends entirely on its mass. How many of the statements given above are correct? (a) Only one (b) Only two (c) All three (d) None Explanation ‚Äî¬†Thestars in the sky seem to shine forever, but they too are subject to lifespans determined by their mass and internal physics. Some last for billions of years and others are transitory in comparison, with far shorter lifetimes. ‚Äî¬†Regardless of duration, all stars survive by maintaining a balance between two competing forces: the inward pull of gravity and the outward pressure produced by nuclear energy.Hence, statement 1 is correct. ‚Äî¬†In the dense core of a star, nuclear fusion converts hydrogen into helium. This process occurs when extremely high temperatures and pressures allow atomic nuclei, which are ordinarily repelled by positive charges, to collide and fuse, releasing massive energy. That energy heats the surrounding gas, resulting in thermal and radiation pressure that prevents gravitational collapse.Hence, statement 2 is correct. ‚Äî¬†This beautiful explanation of how stars glow was not previously known. Only in 1938, while taking a train to Ithaca, New York, did German-American physicist Hans Bethe scribble down the equations detailing how nuclear fusion powers stars, a breakthrough that earned him the Nobel Prize and resolved one of astrophysics‚Äô most pressing mysteries. ‚Äî¬†But even fusion has its limits. When a star‚Äôs fuel is exhausted, gravity takes over ‚Äî and then the nature of its death depends entirely on its mass.Hence, statement 3 is correct. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Consider the following statements about HeLa cells: 1. They were the first successfully cloned human cells. 2. These cells contributed to the identification of the Bovine Papillomaviruses (BPV) as the primary cause of many types of cervicalcancer. Which of the statements given above is/are correct? (a) 1 only (b) 2 only (c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2 Explanation ‚Äî TheHeLa cellline is one of the most important cell lines in the history of medical science and has been the foundation for some of the most significant advances in this field. ‚Äî HeLa cells were the first successfully cloned human cells, and Jonas Salk used them to test the polio vaccine.Hence, statement 1 is correct. ‚Äî Furthermore, they contributed to the identification of thehuman papillomavirus (HPV)as the primary cause of many types of cervical cancer, including the one that killed Lacks, and were instrumental in the development of the HPV vaccine, which earned its creator, Harald zur Hausen, the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2008.Hence, statement 2 is not correct. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer. With reference to the JN.1 variant of COVID, consider the following statements: 1. It is a sub-lineage of the Omicron variant. 2. This variant is distinguished by its heightened transmissibility and potential to evade immune responses, even in the vaccinated population. 3. JN.1 is most likely to affect the elderly individual and those with underlying health conditions. Which of the statements given above are correct? (a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 1 and 3 only (d) 1, 2 and 3 Explanation ‚Äî¬†TheJN.1 variantis not entirely new, it is a sub-lineage of the Omicron variant that has been circulating globally for some time. ‚Äî¬†This version is distinguished by its heightened transmissibility and potential to evade immune responses, even in the vaccinated population, according to Dr Harish Chafle, senior consultant, intensivist chest physician, bronchoscopist, and sleep disorders expert at Gleneagles Hospital in Parel,Mumbai.Hence, statement 2 is correct. ‚Äî¬†JN.1 is a sublineage of the Omicron type that is currently being closely monitored by the World Health Organisation.Hence, statement 1 is correct. ‚Äî¬†JN.1 is most likely to impact people with low immune systems, the elderly, and those who have pre-existing health issues.Children and healthy adults may also get the virus, but they are likely to recover without significant consequences.Hence, statement 3 is correct. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.

"Punjab Sikhya Kranti: Govt clears first tranche of Rs 12.25 cr to reimburse schools for plaques, ribbon-cutting events",https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-sikhya-kranti-clears-first-tranche-reimburse-schools-plaques-ribbon-cutting-events-10023399/,"The Punjab Education Department has approved the first tranche of Rs 12.25 crore that the state government schools have been spending on ribbon cutting ceremonies, making arrangements to welcome ministers or MLAs or VIPs, and installing inauguration plaques since April 7 this year, under the AAP‚Äôs school education glitz campaign ‚ÄòPunjab Sikhya Kranti‚Äô. The 54-day long drive, from April 7 to May 31, was mired in controversies from Day 1 as the Punjab government ordered school teachers to get new plaques installed, and ribbon-cutting ceremonies attended by local MLAs or ministers for even minor projects ‚Äî from repaired toilets and boundary walls to classrooms and laboratories. Multiple plaques or stones were installed in a school, prompting the opposition parties to dub ‚ÄòPunjab Sikhya Kranti‚Äô as ‚ÄòUdghatan and Stone Kranti‚Äô. The Indian Expresswas the first to report how the Punjab government planned to install plaques for at least 25,000 big or small works, with several schools even installing five to six for minor works, and the inauguration drive alone was estimated at nearly Rs 20 crore. The latest letter by School Education (Elementary) Director Harkirat Kaur, addressed to Punjab district education officers (DEOs), the first tranche of Rs 12.25 crore has been approved for Sikhya Kranti programmes held in schools since April 7. It says that Rs 6.20 crore of the total amount was being allotted to primary schools, and Rs 5.71 crore for middle/high and senior secondary schools, where the inaugurations were held.  Notably, the amount spent by schools on ribbon-cutting ceremonies and welcoming politicians will be counted under the head of ‚Äúconferences, workshops, seminars, and tours‚Äù, it read. According to the district-wise allocation, the maximum amounts ‚Äî Rs 59.80 lakh for primary schools, and Rs 55.80 lakh for middle/high or senior secondary schools ‚Äî have been allocated to Amritsar district, indicating that the maximum number of inaugurations took place there. InLudhiana, Rs 30.20 lakh have been allocated for primary schools, and Rs 23.55 lakh for middle/high and secondary schools. InJalandhar, Rs 40.15 lakh have been sanctioned for primary schools and Rs 41.20 lakh for higher schools. The initial order ‚Äî ahead of the drive‚Äôs commencement ‚Äî had mentioned that schools will be given Rs 5,000 for each granite plaque and for inauguration ceremony arrangements such as sound system, chairs, tent, and snacks, among others, with each school paying category wise ‚Äî Rs 5,000 (primary/middle schools), Rs 10,000 (high schools), and Rs 20,000 (senior secondary schools). With over 25,000 works, planned to be inaugurated in over 12,000 schools, the totalbudgetof the drive was estimated at nearly Rs 20 crore. However, since the government did not release funds in advance, teachers had paid from their pockets to make arrangements and install the plaques. Each plaque had to carry the name of Chief MinisterBhagwant Mannand Education Minister Harjot Singh Bains. Punjab Education Secretary Anindita Mitra said: ‚ÄúThis is the first instalment. We shall be providing a budget for all inaugurations as per the amounts fixed in the letter initially. The remaining amount will also be issued in a few days.‚Äù The Punjab Sikhya Kranti drive was launched by the AAP government to inaugurate at least 25,000 big/small development works in over 12,000 Punjab government schools, with initial orders to install separate plaques for even minor repair works. However, as soon as the drive commenced on April 7 as well as the photos of plaques crediting Mann and Bains for repaired toilets or boundary walls went viral, inviting flak, another fresh order was issued that ‚Äúteachers should not get plaques installed for toilets‚Äù. The government had also faced backlash from the opposition parties including Congress,BJP, and SAD who dubbed it as ‚ÄúUdghatan and Ribbon-Cutting Kranti‚Äù. From Barnala to Pathankot, the plaques installed for repaired toilets went viral. Then, a plaque was installed covering the national anthem painted on a wall in a school in Amritsar district. In Ludhiana, MLA Madan Lal Bagga inaugurated repaired toilets where curtains were installed to hide incomplete works, while in Bathinda district‚Äôs Maur, villagers did not allow the local MLA to inaugurate a boundary wall, alleging it was ‚Äúconstructed four years ago‚Äù. Justifying the installation of plaques, Bains had said: ‚ÄúWhy should we not put them? They are the symbols of failures of the previous governments. They are not just name plates or plaques, they are a reminder of the failure of Congress and Akali-BJP governments in Punjab.‚Äù Divya Goyal is a Principal Correspondent with The Indian Express, based in Punjab.

This Word Means: Boeing 747,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/this-word-means-boeing-747-10022637/,"WHY NOW? The USformally accepted Qatar‚Äôs giftof a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet, valued at around $400 million, on Wednesday (May 21). The US Air Force will attempt to refurbish it to put it into use as part of the President‚Äôs official aircraft fleet, Air Force One. ‚ÄúThe Secretary of Defense has accepted a Boeing 747 from Qatar in accordance with all federal rules and regulations,‚Äù Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said. ‚ÄúThe Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the president of the United States.‚Äù WHY THIS PLANE? US PresidentDonald Trump, while accepting the ‚Äògift‚Äô earlier this month, said he would be ‚Äòstupid‚Äô to turn it down. And with good reason. The 747-8 is one of the world‚Äôs most luxurious jets and belongs to a newer fleet of planes than the current batch that forms part of Air Force One. According to aBusiness Insiderarticle, the interiors of the jet have been designed by French interior design firm Cabinet Alberto Pinto and reflect its previous use by a Middle Eastern businessman. The interiors of the jet are currently sectioned into several rooms, including a foyer and bedrooms, similar to a house. Unlike a traditional aircraft with seats that confine passengers to a steady position, this jumbojet resembles a two-storeyed luxury villa and features lounges and dining areas, private offices and guest bedrooms, bathrooms, beds and suites. The showers in particular are a major selling point of the Boeing and Airbus luxury jets, according to the article. WHAT ARE SOME CONCERNS AROUND THE GIFT? Across party lines, lawmakers of both the Democratic Party and Trump‚Äôs own Republican Party are investigating whether the ‚Äògift‚Äô violates ethical and legal guidelines. According to the US Constitution‚Äôs Emoluments Clause, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 was designed to shield the republic from foreign influence. It reads, ‚ÄúNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.‚Äù The gift has also raised questions of impropriety, with lawmakers wondering if Qatar is attempting to purchase influence with the US, or if the plane itself may be equipped with spying devices. According to a report byThe New York Times, some members of Congress worry that Trump will pressure the US Air Force to expedite work for its readiness as a presidential plane, and may not allow the time to integrate the required security measures into the plane. The Air Force One, which carries the President, will need to be equipped with defence systems against missiles or even nuclear weapons. According to theNYTreport, Qatar has been attempting to dispose of this plane for the last five years since it was last used by members of the royal family. The article cited an airline broker as saying he had a hard time finding a buyer for 747 jets, whose manufacture was stopped in 2022. These planes are expensive to operate and use four engines, while current heads of state rely on the less expensive two-engine jet planes.

"Wife, friend booked for abetment month after man dies by suicide",https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/wife-friend-abetment-man-dies-suicide-10022840/,"The Mumbai police Wednesday registered an FIR against the wife of a 28-year-old man who allegedly died by suicide in Chunabhatti on April 18. Police said the deceased, Siddhant Ratne, son of a retired police constable, left behind a note in which he blamed his wife and her friend for driving him to die by suicide. The two accused are absconding. As per the FIR, Siddhant was found dead at his Chunabhatti residence on April 18. Soon after the incident, his parents, including his father Yadav Ratne, who retired fromMumbaiPolice in November 2024, came to the city from Yavatmal where they were residing. They took Siddhant‚Äôs body to their native place where the last rites were carried out. On May 17, Yadav received a letter sent by Siddhant in which the latter mentioned the alleged harassment by his wife. Yadav further said that in spite of being aware of her relationship with a friend, he did not seek divorce as he was concerned about their two-year-old daughter. Siddhant‚Äôs father then returned to Mumbai to check his son‚Äôs phone. Here he found a video shot by Siddhant before he died by suicide, in which he asked his father to ‚Äúnot spare‚Äù his wife Mansi, her friend Yuvraj Jadhav, and another of their friend who allegedly drove him to suicide. Yadav also found a photograph of the letter in which he mentioned that Mansi and Jadhav were having a relationship, which drove him to suicide. He also found chats between his son and Jadhav, in which the latter allegedly told him that he was having an affair with his wife and said: ‚ÄúYou kill yourself, I will take care of her.‚ÄùYadav further alleged that he found chats between his son and daughter-in-law in which she claims to have relationship with three persons. Yadav approached the local Chunabhatti police station with this evidence. His statement was recorded and the police registered an abetment to suicide case against Mansi and Jadhav.

California judge blocks Trump administration from revoking legal status of international students,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-court-block-student-visa-cancellations-trump-immigration-policies-10023105/,"A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking the legal status of international students across the US while a lawsuit challenging earlier terminations proceeds. US District Judge Jeffrey S. White in Oakland issued an injunction on Thursday preventing the government from arresting, incarcerating, or relocating students based solely on their visa status until the case is resolved, news agencyAssociated Pressreported. Students can still be detained for other reasons, and their status may be revoked if they are convicted of violent crimes with prison terms longer than a year. While most courts hearing similar cases have granted protections to plaintiffs, Judge White noted that the government‚Äôs actions ‚Äúwreaked havoc‚Äù not only on the plaintiffs but also on other nonimmigrants holding student visas in the US. White, a Republican nominated by President George W. Bush, granted the nationwide injunction at the request of attorneys representing about two dozen students whose legal status was abruptly terminated in early April by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). As per AP report, more than 4,700 international students had their permission to study in the US cancelled this springwith little notice or explanation, part of PresidentDonald Trump‚Äôs crackdown on immigrants and foreign nationals. During court proceedings, Department of Homeland Security officials revealed they had run the names of student visa holders through an FBI database containing suspects and arrested individuals‚Äîeven if charges were dropped or never filed. Some students chose to leave the US rather than face possible deportation to a third country. Government lawyers argue that the administration is exercising its authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act and claim students do not need court protections because ICE reinstated their legal status and mailed reactivation letters to affected students. However, Judge White found those measures insufficient. He pointed out that the erroneous revocations remain on students‚Äô records, impacting their ability to obtain new visas or change their nonimmigrant status. Many students continue to face consequences from the prior terminations with no assurance their status won‚Äôt be revoked again on a whim. The judge also criticized the administration for rolling out new policies or actions that appear designed to circumvent the court‚Äôs concerns. ‚ÄúIt is unclear how this game of whack-a-mole will end unless Defendants are enjoined from skirting their own mandatory regulations,‚Äù White wrote. (With Inputs from Associated Press) The CBI has filed a chargesheet against seven people, including former Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik, for corruption in awarding a contract for a hydel project. Malik had alleged that he was offered bribes to clear files, leading to the CBI registering two cases. The project has also faced allegations of substandard work and failure to provide jobs to local youth."
"As Lego opens first store in India, toymaker targets new customers, including adults",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/lego-first-store-in-india-toymaker-targets-new-customers-adults-10022607/,"When you enter the newly opened Lego store in Gurugram‚Äîthe toymaker‚Äôs first in India‚Äîyou will find that its iconic brick-like toys are not reserved for kids alone. Adults, too, are avid collectors of the Danish company‚Äôs colourful building-block sets, and Lego is counting on them for future growth. ‚ÄúThe Gurugram store is the closest to delivering the most authentic experience for a Lego fan in India,‚Äù Bhavana Mandon, Country Manager for the Lego Group in India, toldindianexpress.com, ahead of the opening of its first certified store in the country on Friday. Located in Ambience Mall, Gurugram‚Äîjust a short distance fromDelhi‚Äôs Indira Gandhi International Airport‚Äîthe 4,500-sq-ft store is Lego‚Äôs largest in South Asia. ‚ÄúWe looked at a few cities before we came in, and we felt there was a very strong audience connection in Gurugram,‚Äù Mandon said, when asked why Lego chose the city for its first store in India. ‚ÄúWe found the right location‚Äîwhere the audience could come in‚Äîand it matched the kind of store and experience we wanted to offer,‚Äù she added, noting that they did not want to deliver a half-baked experience. ‚ÄúI think it was just about getting it right with the store.‚Äù Mandon said the Gurugram store is modelled after other Lego stores around the world, meaning it includes elements like a pick-a-brick wall, a build-a-minifigure station, and play tables‚Äîsimilar to those found in US stores. However, while designing the store, the company also focused on adding local elements, keeping the country in mind. For example, the store features uniquely Indian touches such as a 3D model of a cricketer and a mosaic wall depicting India Gate. The store also features a mosaic made from 74,000 bricks representing India. Consumers in India have been buying Lego brick sets for years, but Mandon said that in the absence of a standalone store, many parents would wait for a trip abroad to get their hands on the latest sets. ‚ÄúAlthough we have a strong online business, we are never able to deliver the kind of experience that a physical store offers,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe India store will be the first time customers can walk in and build a Lego set on their own‚Äîwhich is exactly the experience we hope to bring to kids.‚Äù Mandon said the Gurugram store will offer Lego‚Äôs widest range of products in India, with over 250 exclusive sets available only at the certified Lego store. ‚ÄúA lot of parents ask us, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs different about Lego bricks?‚Äô I think once you visit the store, you will see the full range and understand the appeal. For example, if your child loves vehicles, we have an entire collection focused on that. If they are into fantasy, there is a whole range available for that too. Until now, there wasn‚Äôt a place to showcase the breadth of our portfolio to parents. With this store, we aim to finally do that,‚Äù she said. But Lego, the world‚Äôs largest toymaker, is not focusing solely on its traditional customer base of kids and parents. Adults love Lego too‚Äîin fact, the brand has one of the most loyal adult fan bases of any company. Many of its new products are primarily aimed at adults, regardless of whether they have children. The trend started long before theCOVID-19pandemic, as many adults turned to Lego bricks and collectible toys to tap into their inner child for comfort. Nostalgia is another major factor behind the booming ‚Äòkidult‚Äô market, and the toy industry is taking note‚Äîespecially the $10 billion Lego Group. Mandon agreed that adults love playing and building with Lego bricks, and there is a magical element to the experience. It is about self-indulgence and pressure-free creative fulfilment‚Äîsomething that makes playing with Lego distinct from other hobbies. ‚ÄúWe definitely believe there is a lot of value in play for adults. Across the globe, we are seeing this audience grow, as more adults seek meaningful distractions from work. This kind of distraction actually helps them focus better,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe have seen a surge in the fan community, and as a result, we have strengthened our portfolio to meet the growing demand. India is no different as a market.‚Äù The Gurugram store will feature a large section dedicated to adults, and the brand has ensured its new ‚Äú18+‚Äù labelling clearly indicates which Lego sets are designed specifically for them. ‚ÄúThe adult section is for those who are into cars and vehicles, botanicals for people who enjoy building flowers, or those who like building fantasy worlds and castles,‚Äù she said, adding, ‚ÄúFrom a portfolio perspective, we have tried to represent all kinds of passions that adults have.‚Äù Adults‚Äîespecially collectors‚Äîhave become a major part of Lego‚Äôs growth story in recent years, as well as for the broader toy industry. While it is unclear how many of Lego‚Äôs consumers are adults, experts say targeting adult fans is a smart move for the brand, as they are likely to have higher purchasing power. At the India store, prices range from Rs 349 to as high as Rs 80,000. ‚ÄúWe have tried to maintain a well-represented portfolio across low, medium, and high price points,‚Äù Mandon said. ‚ÄúThere are kids who have never built with Lego bricks or just want to experience the product for the first time. So, we are trying to give them the opportunity to test and explore building.‚Äù Mandon said the idea behind the Lego store is to create a ‚Äúfun‚Äù space where kids can come with their families and adults can spend time as well. ‚ÄúThere are kids who can build but cannot tell stories, and there are kids who can tell stories but cannot build. We want to welcome all of them through the store,‚Äù she said. Lego has active partnerships with several well-known brands, including Japanese gaming giant Nintendo. However, Mandon indicated that Lego-Nintendo sets will not be available in India, as such partnerships are often country-specific. Once the store opens to the public on Friday, Lego plans to host various activities to engage customers, including workshops and build-together sessions. After the Gurugram store, Lego plans to open its second store at Orion Mall inBengaluru. While the launch date has not been finalised, Mandon said the opening is expected sometime between Q2 and Q3 of this calendar year Anuj Bhatia is a personal technology writer at indianexpress.com who has been covering smartphones, personal computers, gaming, apps, and lifestyle tech actively since 2011.

"Looking into ‚Äòany egregious violations‚Äô in IndusInd Bank case, says Sebi chairman",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sebi-violations-indusind-bank-case-10021895/,"Amid charges of insider trading by the officials of IndusInd Bank, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is looking into ‚Äúany egregious violations‚Äù by the Bank‚Äôs management. While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is looking into the issue, the capital markets regulator is also probing the matter under its remit, Sebi Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey said on Thursday. ‚ÄúThe RBI is looking into that. Whatever Sebi has to do in relation to, whatever Sebi‚Äôs remit is, Sebi is doing. It is RBI‚Äôs remit but if there are any egregious violations by anyone, in its capacity Sebi is looking into it,‚Äù Pandey said at an Assocham event. On March 10,IndusIndBank had disclosed that an internal review of its derivative portfolio revealed a potential 2.35 per cent adverse impact on its net worth. Later, on April 29, weeks after IndusInd Bank disclosed accounting lapses and losses of nearly Rs 2,000 crore in its derivatives portfolio that triggered a rout in its shares, the bank‚Äôs Managing Director & CEO Sumant Kathpalia had resigned with immediate effect. IndusInd Bank had earlier announced the resignation of deputy CEO Arun Khurana. IndusInd Bank has reported a net loss of Rs 2,329 crore for the quarter ended March 2025, the first quarterly loss in 19 years. The Bank had posted a net profit of¬†Rs 2,349 crore a year ago. IndusInd Bank‚Äôs board on Wednesday said that it suspects the occurrence of fraud against the Bank and the involvement of certain employees having a significant role in the accounting and financial reporting of the Bank. ‚ÄúThough the capital adequacy of the bank is quite healthy, for business growth, should any further equity be required, IIHL, as the promoter of IBL, remains committed to supporting the bank, as it has done over the past 30 years,‚Äù said Ashok P. Hinduja, chairman, IndusInd International Holdings Ltd (IIHL), promoter of IndusInd Bank. As per directives on investments issued by the RBI in September 2023, banks are prohibited from conducting internal trades/hedging and, accordingly, IndusInd Bank ceased internal trades from April 1, 2024. However, during an internal review, the bank identified certain discrepancies, wherein the accounting of losses on forex derivatives/ swap transactions executed prior to April 2024 (over the past 5-7 years) to hedge forex deposits/ debt were not recognised through net interest income, while the corresponding treasury gains were recognised in the profit and loss statement. Following the announcement, several broking firms downgraded the bank‚Äôs stock. NSEIPO The Sebi Chairman also said that all outstanding issues in the National Stock Exchange‚Äôs (NSE‚Äôs)initial public offering(IPO) will be resolved soon. ‚ÄúAll the outstanding issues will be resolved and we will move forward‚Ä¶NSE and Sebi are talking, they are resolving the issues and I‚Äôm very hopeful it will be cleared and will move forward,‚Äù Pandey said. He, however, did not specify a timeline. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt give a timeline but we should be doing it soon,‚Äù he said. Last month, the Sebi Chairman had said that the regulator will not allow commercial interests to ‚Äòoverride‚Äô public interest while deciding the NSE‚Äôs IPO application. The NSE‚Äôs IPO proposal has been pending with the Sebi for the last eight years. The NSE had filed its draft herring prospectus in 2016, and is still awaiting the regulator‚Äôs nod. The regulator has had concerns about governance and co-location. The bourse has now restarted its listing process by applying for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) at the Sebi. In March, Sebi had announced the formation of an internal committee to look into NSE‚Äôs IPO.

How derivative losses forced IndusInd Bank to declare first quarterly losses in 19 years,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/derivative-losses-forced-indusind-bank-first-quarterly-losses-19-years-10021881/,"Hit by losses in the derivative portfolio and weak asset quality, IndusInd Bank Ltd has reported a net loss of Rs 2,329 crore for the quarter (Q4) ended March 2025 as against a net profit of Rs 2,349 crore a year ago. On March 10, 2025, the bank disclosed that it noted certain discrepancies in its derivative portfolio. The internal review by the bank had estimated an adverse impact of approximately 2.35 per cent of the bank‚Äôs net worth as of December 2024. Following the disclosure, the bank‚Äôs Managing Director & CEO Sumant Kathpalia and deputy CEO Arun Khurana resigned in April. First quarterly loss in 19 years IndusIndBank reported a net loss of Rs 2,329 crore for the quarter ended March 2025 as against a net profit of Rs 2,349 crore a year ago. This was mainly led by the derivative losses and rise in non-performing assets. It was the first quarterly loss for the bank in 19 years. The two new accounting discrepancies in interest income, unearthed in the internal audits last week worth Rs 674 crore and Rs 595 crore, were also reflected in the March quarter results. As a result, its provisions increased to Rs 2,522 crore in March 2025 as against Rs 950 crore a year ago. The gross NPA increased to 3.13 per cent as against 2.25 per cent as on December 31, 2024. Net non-performing assets were 0.95 per cent as compared to 0.68 per cent. ‚ÄúThe Board and the Management acknowledge that the lapses happened have been unfortunate for an institution like our Bank. However, the Board along with the management have shown a strong resolve to address all the identified issues in a timely and comprehensive manner,‚Äù said Sunil Mehta, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, IndusInd Bank. ‚ÄúI express my continued, unequivocal trust in the Chairman and board of the bank for their appropriate,swiftactions in order to address discrepancies and attendant areas of concern,‚Äù said Ashok P. Hinduja, Chairman, IndusInd International Holdings Ltd (IIHL), promoter of IndusInd Bank. Disclosure of derivative losses On March 10, 2025, IndusInd Bank disclosed that an internal review of its derivative portfolio had revealed a potential 2.35 per cent adverse impact on its net worth, which would have an impact of approximately Rs 2,000 crore on the bank. While the bank sought to shift the blame to the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs (RBI) change in rules relating to the derivative portfolio, the loss from the derivative book remained unresolved for a long time, leading to the accumulation of losses. As per directives on investments issued by the RBI in September 2023, banks are prohibited from conducting internal trades/hedging and, accordingly, IndusInd Bank ceased internal trades from April 1 2024. However, during an internal review, the bank identified certain discrepancies, wherein the accounting of losses on forex derivatives/ swap transactions executed prior to April 2024 (over the past 5-7 years) to hedge forex deposits/ debt were not recognised through NII (net interest income), while the corresponding treasury gains were recognised in the profit and loss (P&L) statement. Following the announcement, several broking firms downgraded the bank‚Äôs stock. Its shares crashed by 27 per cent on the stock exchanges on March 11. Amid the derivative loss issue, the exit of the bank‚Äôs CFO Gobind Jain and the decision of CEO Sumant Kathpalia and Deputy CEO Arun Khurana to sell shares worth Rs 157 crore in the last two years came to the spotlight. The bank appointed an independent professional firm to conduct a comprehensive investigation of derivative losses. RBI‚Äôs assessment of the bank‚Äôs health Allaying the fears of depositors, the RBI on March 15 said that IndusInd Bank depositors need not worry since the bank‚Äôs financial health remains stable. ‚ÄúThere is no need for depositors to react to the speculative reports at this juncture. The bank‚Äôs financial health remains stable and is being monitored closely by the Reserve Bank,‚Äù the regulator said in a statement. The bank is well-capitalised and the financial position of the bank remains satisfactory, the RBI said. ‚ÄúAs per auditor-reviewed financial results of the bank for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the bank has maintained a comfortable capital adequacy ratio of 16.46 per cent and provision coverage ratio of 70.20 per cent,‚Äù the RBI said. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of the bank was at 113 per cent as on March 9, 2025, as against regulatory requirement of 100 per cent. External audit reports On April 15, IndusInd Bank said the report prepared by the external agency ‚Äì PwC ‚Äî showed Rs 1,979 crore of ‚Äònegative impact‚Äô to the net worth of the bank due to the derivative discrepancies. ‚ÄúBased on the report, the bank said that it has assessed an adverse impact of 2.27 per cent to its net worth as of 2024,‚Äù the lender had said in an exchange filing. The bank also disclosed the ongoing review by an external agency which was independently reviewing the internal findings. ‚ÄúThe report from the external agency identified discrepancies relating to derivative deals,‚Äù it said. According to an audit report by Grant Thornton, two former officials of IndusInd Bank were allegedly involved in insider trading during a period when the bank faced accounting lapses in its derivative portfolio. Resignations of the CEO and Deputy CEO Weeks after IndusInd Bank disclosed accounting lapses and losses of nearly Rs 2,000 crore in its derivatives portfolio that triggered a rout in its shares, the bank‚Äôs Managing Director & CEO Sumant Kathpalia resigned with effect from April 29. In his letter to the lender‚Äôs board, Kathpalia wrote, ‚ÄúI undertake moral responsibility, given the various acts of commission/ omission that have been brought to my notice. I would request that my resignation be taken on record at close of working hours today.‚Äù A day prior to Kathpalia‚Äôs resignation, the bank‚Äôs deputy CEO Arun Khurana also resigned. Leadership transition IndusInd Bank‚Äôs board has started the process for identifying potential CEO candidates. The RBI has advised the lender to submit proposals for appointment of the new CEO for its approval by June 30, 2025. The bank said that its board is at an advanced stage in the selection process and is confident that recommendations will be submitted to the RBI well in advance of the timeline. In the interim, the Committee of Executives (CoE) is entrusted to oversee the operations of the bank under the guidance of an Oversight Committee of the Board. ‚ÄúThis would lead to higher standards of transparency and governance, leading to rebuilding trust in the bank. The coordinated efforts of current management under the guidance and monitoring of the Board and other stakeholders have ensured that the bank‚Äôs business remains healthy, with robust capital adequacy,‚Äù said Ashok P. Hinduja, Chairman, IIHL. The continued confidence of the customers in the bank shows their trust in the institution, which has always been upheld. ‚ÄúThis shall be a new dawn with a sanitised slate to regain the position the Bank enjoyed for many decades,‚Äù he added.  The CBI has filed a chargesheet against seven people, including former Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik, for corruption in awarding a contract for a hydel project. Malik had alleged that he was offered bribes to clear files, leading to the CBI registering two cases. The project has also faced allegations of substandard work and failure to provide jobs to local youth."

"When Parliament convened in 1962 amid China war, and PM Nehru faced Opposition questions",https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/parliament-1962-china-war-and-pm-nehru-10023392/,"Pushkar Banakar Stepping up its attack on the BJP-led NDA government for sending all-party delegations to various countries in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Thursday referred to the teams as ‚Äúweapons of mass distraction‚Äù. Labelling the delegations as ‚Äúmeaningless optical exercises‚Äù, Ramesh recalled how Jawaharlal Nehru advanced a Parliament session during the 1962 war with China. ‚ÄúThe continued refusal of the PM to call a session of Parliament and meanwhile send a delegation of 50 MPs to different countries ‚Ä¶ is all domestic optics and meaningless,‚Äù said the Congress communications chief. The 1962 conflict started after the Indian armed forces came under attack from China and continued from October 20 to November 21. On November 8, the first day of the advanced session, Nehru introduced two resolutions. The first was to approve a national Emergency and the second was to condemn China‚Äôs actions. ‚ÄúChina has betrayed this goodwill and initiated a massive invasion of India by her armed forces. They (the Chinese) are just wholly an irresponsible country believing, I believe, in war as the only way of settling anything‚Ä¶ having no love of peace,‚Äù he said. Saying that the conflict had ‚Äúbrought to the forefront the greatness of India‚Äôs people‚Äù, the PM said, ‚ÄúThe flame of liberty and sacrifice has been kindled anew‚Ä¶We stand, I do believe, at a turning point not only in the history of India but of Asia and possibly even of the world‚Ä¶ this conflict has very wide-reaching consequences.‚Äù Dismissing that the government and the armed forces had been caught unawares, the PM said, ‚ÄúMuch of the talk about our unpreparedness is based on ignorance‚Ä¶ It is true we were not prepared for two or three divisions of the Chinese descending on us suddenly.‚Äù The Lok Sabha passed both resolutions unanimously. Five days later, when the issue again came up for discussion on the floor of the House, Nehru was more emotional. Admitting that India ‚Äúmight not have been quite prepared‚Äù, the PM said, ‚ÄúI am not sorry for that. I think it was a right urge (for peace).‚Äù Responding to rumours that Indian soldiers were fighting unarmed and barefoot, the PM said such statements were ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù. ‚ÄúThey had woollen uniforms, good boots, three blankets ‚Äî later four ‚Äî and full winter clothing,‚Äù he told the Lok Sabha. When nominated MP Frank Antony urged India to be ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù in its response to the Chinese, Nehru said, ‚ÄúBy becoming brutal, we lose our soul. I hope our nation, much less my humble self, will never be brutalised. We have had a glimpse of the strength of the serene face of India‚Ä¶ strong and yet calm and determined.‚Äù On possible talks with China and recognition of the border ‚Äî theLine of Actual Controland the McMahon Line ‚Äî the PM said, ‚ÄúOne does not talk with anybody whom one has defeated completely ‚Ä¶ If we have gained our objective, the question of talks does not arise. The suggestion we have made about the September 8 line is one which has been appreciated in a great part of the world, including non-aligned countries and others.‚Äù On November 19, as the war raged on, Nehru apprised Parliament of the Army‚Äôs losses in Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh, including in Rezang La in the Chushul Valley. ‚ÄúFighting is still going on. This is bad news. I cannot go into further details at this stage. I should like to add that in spite of the reverses suffered by us, we are determined not to give in in any way and we shall fight the enemy, however long it may take to repel him and drive him out of our country,‚Äù he added. A day after the Chinese proposed a ‚Äúunilateral‚Äù ceasefire, Nehru on November 21 informed Parliament about it. Janata Party MP Hari Vishnu Kamath cited the PM‚Äôs earlier broadcast and demanded consistency from him. ‚ÄúThe Prime Minister declared there would be no talks and no negotiations unless and until every inch of our sacred motherland is cleared of the Chinese invaders‚Ä¶ I hope he will today give a categorical assurance‚Ä¶ and there will be no departure from that policy.‚Äù Reiterating India‚Äôs core condition to negotiate with the Chinese, Nehru said, ‚ÄúOur position in regard to any negotiations continues to be what we have previously stated, that is, that the position as it existed prior to September 8, 1962, shall be restored.‚Äù The PM also emphasised vigilance about any communication that came from the Chinese side. Antony applauded Nehru‚Äôs resolve while calling the ceasefire ‚Äúcalculated Chinese trickery to prepare another base‚Äù. The House discussed the war again on December 10, where the Opposition stepped up its attack on the government. Questioning the higher-ups of the armed forces and the failure of the intelligence set-up, Antony said, ‚ÄúThe reverses in NEFA were not the reverses of our fighting men‚Ä¶ They were the reverses of bad generalship‚Ä¶ inexperienced command‚Ä¶ Our military intelligence probably failed. We knew less of our topography in NEFA (present-day Arunachal Pradesh) than the Chinese‚Ä¶ This created frustration.‚Äù Countering him, Nehru claimed that the intelligence was ‚Äúfirst-class‚Äù and that India had done ‚Äúreasonably well with our resources‚Äù as compared to richer nations. ‚ÄúOur Army or our fighting jawans are not lacking in courage or steadfastness‚Ä¶ I am sure they are the best of their kind in the world. Let nobody think there was a terrible disaster falling on the Indian Army ‚Ä¶ There were defeats due to a variety of causes, but the Army is sound at heart‚Ä¶ Our army has not been trained in the particular guerrilla-style tactics used by the Chinese. We will train parts of it now to adapt to this method,‚Äù he said. As the discussion continued, India‚Äôs non-alignment policy came under fire from Opposition MPs. Defending the policy, Nehru said, ‚ÄúIt is never good to change a policy in which you believe under stress of circumstances‚Ä¶ that other policy may not lead to better results ‚Ä¶ We must take the help of friendly countries who are willing to assist us in this sacred task ‚Ä¶ This does not violate our non-alignment.‚Äù When the Dalai Lama came up in the debate, Nehru said he was ‚Äúfree to say what he wanted but India would not permit a (Tibetan) government to be established on its land‚Äù. ‚ÄúThat would just give justification to Chinese accusations‚Ä¶ We cannot undertake to liberate Tibet. If it happens organically, so be it. But for us to hold up that banner now would not be wise,‚Äù he added. On China, the PM said the neighbouring country was ‚Äúdeveloping a peculiar form of Communism that even other Communist countries consider dangerous‚Äù. ‚ÄúUnlike other Communist countries, China is pursuing a policy of dismembering Asia, limb by limb ‚Äî by threat, awe, and domination. This impression that China‚Äôs military superiority is absolute is a myth. Their tradition of pacifism still lingers beneath the surface. Asia has never seen a country so armed to the teeth as China is today ‚Ä¶ China intends more than just defending its borders,‚Äù Nehru said, adding that he was prepared to refer the dispute to theInternational Court of Justiceat The Hague only if ‚Äúaggression is vacated‚Äù."
"Explained: Alleged NREGA scam in Gujarat, in which Minister Bachubhai Khabad‚Äôs sons were arrested",https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/alleged-nrega-scam-gujarat-bachubhai-khabad-bjp-10022156/,"A police investigation into an alleged Rs 71-crore scam, stemming from works carried out under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), has led to a political controversy in Gujarat. At its centre is Bachubhai Khabad, the Minister of State for Panchayat and Agriculture, whose two sons have been arrested in the case. His son Balvantsinh was taken into custody on Saturday (May 17). Two days later, police apprehended Kiran, who had been absconding after withdrawing a jointly filed anticipatory bail plea in Dahodwith his brother. What is the alleged scam? It came to light when BM Patel, Director of the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA), discovered significant irregularities in the payments for incomplete projects under the MGNREGA. The projects spanned two villages in the Devgadh Baria taluka and one village in the Dhanpur taluka, where several metres of road construction were left incomplete. However, payments were still made to ‚Äúunauthorised agencies‚Äù using forged completion certificates between April 2021 and December 2024. Thirty-five unauthorised agencies, which did not participate in the tender process or emerge as the lowest bidders, received payments regardless. Two of them ‚Äì Raj Construction and Raj Traders ‚Äì are run by Balvantsinh and Kiran. What does the case FIR say? The DRDA director filed an FIR on April 24, stating that the three villages reported forged completion reports with payments ‚Äúmade in connivance‚Äù to ‚Äúunauthorised‚Äù agencies for supplying raw materials. Of the 35 agencies, 28 in Devgadh Baria received payments for non-existent roads. The FIR states, ‚ÄúAn inspection was carried out of the projects under the MGNREGA schemes undertaken between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2024, in the villages of Kuva and Redhana in Devgadh Baria taluka and Simamoi village in Dhanpur taluka. It came to light that despite being incomplete, the completion certificates and false evidence were forged to complete the payments for these works‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAll the unauthorised agencies as well as government officials concerned and other MGNREGA staff, in connivance with each other and as part of a prior criminal conspiracy, executed fraud and criminal breach of trust by using forged documents to cause a loss to the government treasury‚Ä¶,‚Äù it added. Officials said Rs 71 crores of payments were allegedly made on ‚Äúforged‚Äù bills to unauthorised agencies. A claim amount of Rs 150 crores made under the MGNREGA projects is also under scrutiny in the same case. Police officials said that the ‚Äúactual estimate of the amount of loss to the state treasury‚Äù is yet to be ascertained. According to the FIR, the alleged scam in Kuva village involves 41 MGNREGA works, including roads and check dams. Of the 25,066 metres of road shown as completed, only 15,176 metres were constructed. The biggest discrepancy was in Simamoi in Dhanpur, the Khabad family‚Äôs home taluka. Across the 38 MGNREGA works, only 3,492 meters out of 19,200 metres of roads have been constructed, but full payment was made. What has the political fallout been? Along with Balvantsinh and Kiran, officers such as the then Taluka Development Officer (TDO) of Devgadh Baria were arrested. Dilip Chauhan, a former Assistant Programme Officer (APO) and a distant relative of the Khabads, is also among the 14 accused arrested so far. All accused people have been arrested under Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita Sections [316(2), 316(5)] (criminal breach of trust), 318(4) (cheating), 336(2) (forgery), 338 (forgery of valuable security, will), 340(2) (Forged document or electronic record and using it as genuine), 61(2) (criminal conspiracy). The opposition Congress has been demanding Khabad‚Äôs resignation, and Congress leader Amit Chavda has also sought the formation of a Special Investigation Team, calling the ongoing investigations an ‚Äúeyewash‚Äù. Khabad, in two video messages released Tuesday and Wednesday, has expressed faith in the process, claiming his sons were ‚Äúonly involved in a legal business of supplying materials‚Äù and did not have the ‚Äúresponsibility of completing the projects‚Äù. In the lastBudgetsession of the Gujarat Assembly, even before the FIR was filed, opposition leader Amit Chavda had alleged corruption of over Rs 100 crore in MGNREGA in Dahod. He also sought an investigation by the Vigilance Commission. Belonging to the Koli community that falls under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, Khabad is a four-time MLA from the Devgadh Baria constituency. He first won the Assembly constituency in 2002 with a margin of 51,157 votes. Thereafter, Khabad won in the 2012, 2017 and 2022 elections, and declared assets worth Rs 92 lakh in the 2022 Assembly polls. In November 2022, ahead of the Assembly polls, the Congress had accused Khabad of ‚Äúorchestrating the withdrawal of the nomination‚Äù of NCP candidate Gopal Lavre, as the Devgadh Baria seat was in a seat-sharing alliance between the Congress and the NCP. Khabad won with a lead of 44,201 votes and a vote share of 58.27% againstAam Aadmi Party(AAP) candidate Vakhala Bharatsinh. He has been a minister in the Gujarat government since 2014, handling portfolios such as animal husbandry, fisheries, forest and environment, rural housing, rural development, and cow conservation. Khabad has cited agriculture and business as his occupations. He is also associated with various religious and educational institutes. On Wednesday, as he skipped the weekly Cabinet meeting inGandhinagar, Khabad released a video where he lashed out at ‚Äúcritics for accusing him of going underground‚Äù amid the scam allegations. He said he was busy with the party‚Äôs organisational work and that the ‚Äútruth will be brought out‚Äù by the investigations. Sources in theBJPsaid that following Balvantsinh‚Äôs arrest, the party is considering multiple options, such as dropping him from the council of ministers. In two separate incidents, the Mumbai police have detained a model and a 23-year-old youth from Chhattisgarh, both reportedly fans of Salman Khan, for allegedly trying to enter the high-security Bandra house of the actor."

"In finding elderly couple‚Äôs killers, Tamil Nadu cops ‚Äòcrack last year‚Äôs triple homicide, prevent upcoming heist‚Äô",https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/tamil-nadu-police-triple-homicide-heist-10015961/,"The Tamil Nadu Police on Monday announced the arrest of three men in connection with the murder of an elderly couple found dead inside their farmhouse in Erode district on May 1. According to police, the assailants were careful to choose a house that did not have any CCTV cameras nearby, made sure not to use phones, and wore gloves while committing the crime, making the investigation a challenging one. However, when the case was solved, the police busted a gang that was allegedly responsible for a triple murder in Tiruppur district last year, and was on course to commit another heist. The victims in the Erode case, Ramasamy (72) and his wife Bakkiyam (63) from Vilangattu Valasu village near Sivagiri, were last seen alive on April 28. Three days later, their decomposing bodies were discovered after their son, Kavisankar, alerted relatives that his parents were not answering phone calls. By then, the neighbours had also alerted police about a smell coming from the house. Police found that around 10.75 sovereigns (86 grams) of gold jewellery and a mobile phone were stolen from the house. The case triggered public outrage and criticism from Opposition leaders, including AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami. The case prompted a quick and massive police response. Over 600 police personnel were mobilised under the supervision of Coimbatore Range DIG V Sasi Mohan and Erode SP A Sujatha. Twelve special teams were formed to track down the culprits, combing through local networks of former convicts, farm workers, and known offenders. Investigators examined hours of CCTV footage and call detail records (CDRs) of dozens of suspects. According to one of the investigating officers, the arrests came just in time. The suspects, he said, were plotting another heist. ‚ÄúCracking the case was very tough because they took every precaution before committing the murders,‚Äù the officer toldThe Indian Express. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt carry their cellphones to the crime scene. They used gloves throughout the act. And they had chosen the victims only after confirming there were no CCTV cameras near the house.‚Äù Still, investigators decided to scan all available CCTV cameras across the village. ‚ÄúWe found just one two-wheeler that passed through the area,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe footage didn‚Äôt show the registration number ‚Äî only the vehicle‚Äôs model.‚Äù With no clearer leads, officers began combing through purchase records of that specific model across the region in the last 10 years. ‚ÄúThere was a key strategy in this process. We checked if any of those vehicles were owned by people with previous criminal records. That‚Äôs how we picked up the first suspect during a routine vehicle check. It led us straight to the others,‚Äù he said. The turning point came on May 17, when one of the suspects was stopped during a routine vehicle check in Arachalur. Upon interrogation at the Kadathur police station, he allegedly admitted to the crime, leading to the arrest of two accomplices. The accused were identified as P Aachiappan (48), N Madeswaran (52) and R Ramesh (54), all coconut brokers from Arachalur. According to West Zone Inspector General T Senthil Kumar, Aachiappan had visited the couple weeks before the murder on the pretext of some business, and learned that they lived alone. On the night of April 28, the trio waited near the house. At around midnight, they attacked the woman as she stepped outside, severing her ear and a finger to steal her jewellery. When her husband rushed out, they killed him too. During subsequent searches,police recovered the stolen ornaments, the victim‚Äôs phone, three two-wheelers used by the accused, hand gloves, and the wooden log used in the murder. A local goldsmith, Gyanasekaran of Chennimalai Palayam, who had melted and returned the jewellery to the gang, was also arrested. The case expanded when, under interrogation, the men allegedly confessed to another heinous crime ‚Äî the murder of three of a family in Semalaigoundanpalayam village in Tiruppur district on November 28, 2024. The victims in that case were identified as Deivasigamani (78), his wife Alamathal (74), and their son Senthil Kumar (44). Five and a half sovereigns of gold and a mobile phone were stolen. The CB-CID, which had taken over the Tiruppur case, is now working withErode policeto verify the accused‚Äôs involvement through custodial interrogation and forensic corroboration. All four arrested individuals, including the goldsmith, were produced before a magistrate in Elumathur and remanded to judicial custody. The accused had previously faced trial in five robbery cases in 2015 but had maintained a low profile in the years since, police said. You May Like The CBI has filed a chargesheet against seven people, including former Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik, for corruption in awarding a contract for a hydel project. Malik had alleged that he was offered bribes to clear files, leading to the CBI registering two cases. The project has also faced allegations of substandard work and failure to provide jobs to local youth."
Aanchal Shrivastava‚Äôs music show ‚ÄòYatra with Aanchal‚Äô comes to Pune,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/aanchal-shrivastavas-music-show-yatra-with-aanchal-pune-10022799/,"Qawwali has always been a space dominated by men. Even in modern performance circles, it‚Äôs rare to find a woman leading a full Qawwali set. Aanchal Shrivastava is changing that. On May 24, she will perform her live show ‚ÄòYatra with Aanchal‚Äô at Monalisa Kalagram in Koregaon Park, Pune. The live acoustic set will feature a mix of Qawwali, Sufi, folk, and original compositions. Shrivastava‚Äôs journey with music started when she was just two and a half. After noticing how often she banged on plates and spoons at home, her parents enrolled her in a local music class. The class was meant for older children, but her teacher allowed her in. By three and a half, she had already done her first public performance. Most of her early training came from ‚Äògharanas,‚Äô not from music schools or formal certification courses. That kind of learning, she says, shaped how she sings today ‚Äì especially in Qawwali, which demands power and control. For women, performing Qawwali is not easy. But Shrivastava says the deep, open, and full-breath singing Qawwali requires fits naturally with her training. ‚ÄúWhen I was younger, I‚Äôd tell my dad my throat hurt after singing; I can‚Äôt reach the correct notes. Guruji would say that if you truly want to sing, you must forget your organs. Sing from your stomach and forget about the pain. That stayed with me. You can sing from your throat for only 15 or 20 minutes. It won‚Äôt sustain you. Singing from your stomach is the only way,‚Äù she explains. Growing up, she was often called the Lata Mangeshkar of the school or the Nightingale of her class. ‚ÄúIt was flattering,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut I never really felt I sounded like her. If someone had told me I sounded like Abida Parveen ji, maybe I would‚Äôve realised that I was meant to make powerful music earlier,‚Äù she explains. It took her years to see what direction her voice was taking her. She added, ‚ÄúEven though I started young, I understood what I was made for only three or four years ago, when I left my job and committed to music full-time.‚Äù What made it clear to her was the audience. The response was strong every time she performed Sufi or folk songs, even if people hadn‚Äôt heard them before. Her original track, Ishq Akela, is now a staple in her live sets. ‚ÄúPeople sing along, even if they don‚Äôt know the song. There‚Äôs something raw in it. I think I‚Äôve been blessed with a voice that helps people connect, not just with the music, but with themselves,‚Äù she explains. Her contributions to the music reflect that same depth and emotion as her performances. She has sung for Amazon Prime‚Äôs Four More Shots Please and made her Bollywood debut in Mahesh Bhatt‚Äôs Love Games.

What the loss to LSG means to Gujarat Titans,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/ipl/what-the-loss-to-lsg-means-to-gujarat-titans-10022973/,"SYNOPSIS: On a batting friendly pitch, Will O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs four economical overs prove to be the difference as Gujarat Titans chances of finishing in top two takes a dent It was a night whereLucknow Super Giantsbelatedly showed what their batting unit is capable off as they put on 235/2 in an innings where their overseas trio ofMitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran and Aiden Markram flexed their muscles. As has been the case, the bowlers nearly ended up bottling it before O‚ÄôRourke delivered two key strikes in the 17th over asGujarat Titansshowed their batting was not just about their top three. But they still have plenty of ground to gain. For a top three that has been the envy of the rest, this was a chance to show their might before the play-offs. When the league stage ends, they will be without one of them ‚Äì Jos Buttler, who will head home for international commitments. But going by how their chase of 236 unfolded, Gujarat won‚Äôt be losing sleep. Buttler will be missed, particularly in the business end, but few would bet against this Titans side from going all the way. Their top three ‚Äì B Sai Sudharsan,Shubman Gilland Buttler‚Äîdeparting inside the first 10 overs with the skipper‚Äôs 35 being the highest, all eyes were on how far Gujarat‚Äôs middle-order will take them from here. It was their time to emerge from the shadows and they came close to pulling off an incredible chase. Playing the lead role was Shahrukh Khan and Sherfane Rutherford, who put up a commendable, counter-attacking partnership by feasting on arguably the weakest attack thisIPL. That Rutherford (38) and Shahrukh (56), blessed with muscle power, kept Gujarat in the game till the 17th over wasn‚Äôt a surprise as anything that landed in their arc went the distance. Out of their 40-ball 86, 60 came in boundaries and sixes. The partnership threatened to take the game away from Lucknow before Will O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs twin blows in his final over in the 17th, where he accounted for Rutherford and Rahul Tewatia, put the brakes on Gujarat‚Äôs daring chase. When the rest of Lucknow‚Äôs bowlers were listless and drawing the fury of captainRishabh Pant, it was O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs four overs where he conceded just 27 runs and accounted for Sai Sudharsans‚Äô wicket as well, all to excellent change of pace, that made the difference. For the second consecutive game Lucknow‚Äôs opening duo put up another splendid show with Mitchell Marsh at his punishing best. The well-built West Australian, nicknamed ‚ÄòBison‚Äô, has been threatening to cut loose often this IPL, but hasn‚Äôt been able to prolong his aggressive game. This occasion, after getting another rapid start, he wasn‚Äôt going to squander another glorious opportunity on a placid pitch. He reeled off 117 off 64 deliveries in an innings that included 10 boundaries and 8 sixes that fitted his tag ‚ÄòBison‚Äô. After his partner Aiden Markram got going first, Marsh showed he is in the mood too, as he launched left-arm seamer Arshad Khan over covers off the third ball he faced. From thereon, he was unstoppable. Unlike their game againstSunrisers Hyderabadlast Monday where they got a rapid start, they had to wait patiently to break the shackles as Gujarat‚Äôs attack showed discipline early on. But still they managed 53 runs in the powerplay, a testament to their intent, which they were ready to unleash at any given opportunity. One of the overlooked aspects of Gujarat‚Äôs performance is how their attack has regularly won games in the middle overs. At the same time, when put under sustained pressure, they have sometimes frozen , appearing too rigid with their plans and match-ups. WithRashid Khanstruggling, Gujarat have looked at Prasidh Krishna and R Sai Kishore as their banks. With Marsh showing no signs of holding back against the duo and Markram quietly ticking away, Lucknow put Gujarat under pressure and the cookie crumbled for the former champions. Though Markram perished in the 10th over, Nicholas Pooran walked in at No 3 to sustain the intent. WithKagiso Rabadaalso being taken to cleaners, Gill finally turned to Rashid in the 12th over, which turned into the most expensive over of the innings. It cost 25 runs. Despite having the wood over most established names, the Afghan hasn‚Äôt had a favourable match-up against Marsh, who welcomed Rashid by picking up his googly and depositing over mid-wicket. Three more boundaries and a six flew, as Rashid kept erring on his length. Gujarat were bleeding now as Marsh jogged his way through his maiden IPL century. With Pooran rediscovering his rhythm, it was trouble from both ends as the left-right duo feasted on Gujarat‚Äôs attack to end on 235/2, a total that lived up to their batting standards. If they faltered in the second half of their innings against Hyderabad, against Gujarat they went the opposite way. In the first 10, they scored 97/1 and in the next 10 scored 138/1. Lucknow Super Giants235 for 2 (M Marsh 117, N Pooran 56) beatGujarat Titans202 for 9 (M Shahrukh Khan 57, S Rutherford 38; W O‚ÄôRourke 3/27 ) by 33 runs.

130 censorship orders issued via Home‚Äôs Sahyog portal in 5 months,https://indianexpress.com/article/express-exclusive/130-censorship-orders-issued-via-homes-sahyog-portal-in-5-months-9957698/,"UNDER THE Home Ministry‚Äôs Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)-ledSahyog portal, the government has issued 130 content notices to online platforms like Google, YouTube, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, among others, between October 2024 and April 8, 2025, as per data received byThe Indian Expressthrough a Right to Information (RTI) application. These notices effectively act as content blocking orders and are sent under Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. These fall outside Section 69(A) of the Information Technology Act, that has been commonly used to issue online censorship orders. The number received through the RTI do not reflect the notices sent to Elon Musk-owned X under Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act. Social media platform X is yet to join the Sahyog portal, which was launched last year to expedite the process of sending notices. X has, in fact, sued the government over this, calling it a ‚Äúcensorship‚Äù portal. A separate RTI application filed by this paper also showed that in just two months January-February 2025, the IT Ministry had issued 785 blocking orders to various online intermediaries through the use of Section 69(A) of the IT Act. As per Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act, online intermediaries like X can lose their safe harbour protections if they fail to block access to content which has been flagged by an ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù government agency. Safe harbour protections afford social media platforms legal immunity from hosting user generated content. While orders under this provision can be sent for various reasons, Section 69(A) orders can be sent for only a limited set of national security and public order-related offences. Together, these two separate provisions highlight the parallel content blocking regimes the Central government, along with states and Union Territories, are relying on to direct online companies to take down content the governments find objectionable from their platforms. While only the Centre can issue take down notices through Section 69(A), state governments and UTs, along with the Centre, are doing so through Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act. Companies like Meta, X andGooglerisk losing their legal immunity from third-party content if they fail to take down the links flagged in these blocking orders. While the IT Ministry had directed a number of ministries to designate a nodal officer for issuing notices under Section 79(3)(b), ahead of notifying the IT Rules in February 2021, experts said the use of the provision to issue content blocking orders had picked up significantly in the last two years. The ministries of Home and IT did not respond to a request for comment until publication. This parallel regime is also at the heart of X‚Äôs petition against the government, which has contended that through the use of Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act, multiple government departments and agencies are now issuing content takedown notices to social media companies, ‚Äúattempting to bypass the multiple procedural safeguards‚Äù prescribed under Section 69A of the Act ‚Äì while the latter has some guardrails, such as review committee meetings, the former has no such safeguards. The Home Ministry, in response to the RTI application, said that till now, 65 online intermediaries have been onboarded to the Sahyog portal. Nodal officers from 33 states and Union Territories, along with representatives from seven Central agencies, have also been onboarded. The Central agencies include the I4C, Ministry of Defence, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), Ministry of Heavy Industries, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND), Ministry of Rural Development, and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. While the number of blocking orders issued through the Sahyog portal are 130, one such order could contain multiple links that platforms are expected to act on. For example, as per information shared by the government in the ongoing case against X, it said that between March 20, 2024, and March 20, 2025, the I4C sent online companies, including WhatsApp, Instagram, X, Google, YouTube,Facebook, andSkype, a total of 426 notices under Section 79(3)(b) which included blocking directions for more than 1 lakh pieces of content, ranging from deepfakes and obscenity to influencing the electoral process. Not all of these notices were sent through the Sahyog portal, since it came into being only in October 2024, as a central repository of such notices issued by the various authorised government stakeholders. In its challenge against the Sahyog portal, X has also sought protection for its representatives and employees against coercive action for not joining Sahyog, a Ministry of Home Affairs portal, which it alleged, was a ‚ÄúCensorship Portal‚Äù. The next date of hearing in the case is April 24. The two content blocking regimes have varied levels of safeguards. While experts say both are far from ideal, under Section 69(A) orders, companies get an opportunity of hearing, the limit of blocking is limited to national security and public order related reasons, and companies receive a reasoned, albeit publicly confidential order. Under Section 79(3)(b) blocking orders, these safeguards are absent.

What‚Äôs the ongoing story:Jayant Narlikar, who had contributed immensely to the development of an alternative model of the universe along with his mentor Fred Hoyle, passed away Tuesday morning inPune. He was 87. Ailing for some time, he had had a fall two weeks ago and had to be operated upon last week. Key Points to Ponder: ‚Äî What is the Big Bang theory? ‚Äî What is the steady-state theory of the universe? ‚Äî What is cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation? ‚Äî What is the Hoyle‚ÄìNarlikar theory of gravity (also known as conformal gravity)? ‚Äî What are the various theories associated with the formation of the universe? ‚Äî What are the challenges in the Big bang theory? Key Takeaways: ‚Äî The Big Bang theory suggests that the universe has a definite beginning, and a possible end. In contrast, the steady state theory, which was the mainstream theory in the 1950s and 1960s, maintains that the universe has always been the way it is, without any beginning or an end. ‚Äî The idea has become less popular over time, with mounting evidence that supports the Big Bang theory. But Narlikar remained unconvinced. ‚Äî Acknowledging that he was in a small minority, he argued in his autobiography ‚ÄòA Tale of Four Cities‚Äô that there was still enough evidence to ‚Äúre-examine the situation‚Äù. ‚Äî The Hoyle-Narlikar theory, as it came to be known, on the steady state universe was just one such idea. In the process of formulating their model, the two also came up with an alternative theory of gravity, by modifying Einstein‚Äôs general relativity. ‚Äî Then there was their work on cosmological red-shifts, the fact that light coming from far-away objects appears shifted towards longer wavelengths, corresponding to the red end of the visible spectrum. Narlikar questioned the accepted understanding that the red-shifting was caused mainly by the relative motion of the source. ‚Äî Narlikar did, eventually, return to India after a few years, where he trained several generations of astrophysicists and built institutions like IUCAA. ‚Äî He delved into science fiction, writing short and long stories in Marathi and English, many of which became part of the school curriculum. He pursued science popularisation, and campaigned against superstition and pseudo-science. Do You Know: From Explained:Narliakar‚Äôs challenge to the Big Bang ‚Äî The Hoyle-Narlikar theory produced evidence to support what is known as the steady-state theory of the universe. It is an alternative theory of the universe. ‚Äî Unlike the Big Bang theory that suggests a definite beginning, and possibly an end, to the universe, the steady-state theory maintains that the universe has always been, and would continue to be, the way it is ‚Äî infinite in extent, without a beginning or an end. It acknowledged an expanding universe, which was experimentally verifiable, but proposed that the universe was able to maintain a constant density by continuously creating new matter. ‚Äî Born in 1938 in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, Narlikar was a young PhD student at Cambridge University in the early 1960s, when he produced a series of influential works in cosmology. He did so under the guidance of Hoyle, who had come up with the steady-state theory of the universe in collaboration with Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold. ‚Äî Incidentally, Hoyle is also the one who coined the term ‚ÄòBig Bang‚Äô, referring to that theory in a rather dismissive manner in a radio interview in 1948. ‚Äî Hoyle and Narlikar instead worked to explain the steady-state theory. One of their key ideas in their hypotheses was the constant creation of new matter in the universe. This was important for the model of the universe that they proposed. ‚Äî Despite the elegant mathematics that Narlikar had produced, the steady-state theory slowly lost out, with the emergence of new observations that fit the Big Bang model better. One of the most prominent discoveries in this regard was that of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in 1965. ‚Äî Narlikar, while acknowledging the growing evidence in favour of the Big Bang, maintained that the evidence was still not unambiguous, and was based on several unproven assumptions that were open for challenge. He considered himself amongst the minority that believed that sufficient evidence existed to re-examine the situation.

What‚Äôs the ongoing story:Moving to rally global support for India‚Äôs war against terror emanating from Pakistan, members of the all-party delegations ‚Äì three teams start their foreign visits Wednesday ‚Äì will seek to dispel Pakistani misinformation on Operation Sindoor, expose Islamabad‚Äôs duplicity on countering terror, explain India‚Äôs stand on the Indus Waters Treaty and underline the country‚Äôs ‚Äònew normal‚Äô in response to cross-border terrorism. Key Points to Ponder: ‚Äî What is the purpose of sending delegations to other countries? ‚Äî How important is international cooperation in fighting against terrorism? ‚Äî India‚Äôs retaliatory response demonstrates a credible shift from passive restraint to active deterrence. ‚Äî What do you understand by this statement? ‚Äî What is hyphenation and dehyphenation in international politics? ‚Äî This is not a clash of equals but of a rules-based state and a revisionist actor. What does this mean? Key Takeaways: ‚Äî Three delegations, headed by JDU‚Äôs Sanjay Kumar Jha,Shiv Sena‚Äôs Shrikant Shinde and DMK‚Äôs Kanimozhi, were briefed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri Tuesday. They were told that they will have back-to-back meetings with people from the government (Ministers, MPs and other lawmakers), think tanks, academics, journalists, civil society and others. ‚Äî ‚ÄúOur ambassadors and missions abroad have already started working on lining up the meetings,‚Äù a delegation member said. ‚Äî JDU‚Äôs Jha, who is heading the team visiting Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, said the key message to be conveyed to these countries is that ‚ÄúIndia has had enough‚Äù. Editorial Nirupama Rao writes:What makes this face-off with Pak structurally different is China‚Äôs embedded role ‚Äî The recent bout of hostilities between India and Pakistan has once again exposed the fragility of deterrence in South Asia. This time, however, the conflict cannot be framed solely as a bilateral flashpoint. ‚Äî The United States, returning to its well-worn role of crisis manager, has momentarily revived the India-Pakistan hyphenation that NewDelhihas long worked to dismantle. More consequential, though, is the increasingly visible footprint of China in Pakistan‚Äôs military posture. ‚Äî The conflict may have started on the Line of Control, but it now plays out in a strategic triangle, with each vertex holding different stakes and tactics. ‚Äî India‚Äôs retaliatory response has delivered tactical benefits. It demonstrates a credible shift from passive restraint to active deterrence. ‚Äî The reappearance of hyphenation in global discourse, particularly through American statements seeking to ‚Äúown the ceasefire‚Äù, is a diplomatic regression. For over two decades, India has sought to decouple its international positioning from Pakistan, leveraging its economic scale, democratic governance, and global partnerships. ‚Äî India must engage diplomatically but reject frameworks that reduce its global profile to regional conflict management. The message must remain clear: This is not a clash of equals but of a rules-based state and a revisionist actor. ‚Äî What makes this confrontation structurally different is China‚Äôs embedded role. Beijing is not merely a diplomatic shield for Pakistan but a material enabler. Pakistan‚Äôs current air capabilities are heavily influenced by Chinese platforms. Strategic planners must absorb this reality: Pakistan no longer acts alone, and China no longer stays outside. ‚Äî Ultimately, this is not a moment of collapse but one of recalibration. India is confronting a new strategic geometry: Crises are triangular, platforms are shared, and narratives are contested as much as borders. The US will remain a tempering actor, but not an arbiter of truth. China will remain a silent catalyst. Pakistan, emboldened by both, will remain a spoiler. ‚Äî India‚Äôs task is to respond when needed, restrain when possible, and reinforce its role as a power whose stability is not defined by others‚Äô volatility. In conflict, as in diplomacy, maturity lies not in escalation, but in the control of the terms of engagement. Do You Know: ‚Äî Hyphenation refers to this tendency to link the two countries together in policy decisions and treat them as a single entity. The hyphenation of India and Pakistan-often written as ‚ÄúIndia-Pakistan‚Äù is premised on several factors, including shared history, similar geography, and conflict over Kashmir, among others: both nations ‚Äúshare the federal parliamentary republic government system, along with a mixed economy. India and Pakistan‚Äôs natural resources are also comparable. ‚Äî De-hyphenation is a form of foreign policy where a country keeps diplomatic ties with two or more countries with conflicting interests, without letting the conflicts prioritize one country over another. The policy allows countries to hold independent relations with countries otherwise distrustful or hostile towards each other while treating each country as a single entity rather than as a part of a conflict with the other countries.

This will be the first major tourism festival to be hosted by the state since the start of the conflict in May 2023, making safety concerns and elaborate security arrangements an integral part of the preparations this year. Key Points to Ponder: ‚Äî Learn about the conflict in Manipur ‚Äî What are the important cultural festivals celebrated in northeast India? ‚Äî Which is the state flower of Manipur? ‚Äî Which are the main tribal communities in Manipur? ‚Äî What are the special characteristics of the Shirui Lily? Key Takeaways: ‚Äî The Shirui Lily Festival is organised by the Manipur government‚Äôs Department of Tourism. First held in 2017, it is one of two major tourism festivals organised by the state government. ‚Äî While it is named after the Shirui Lily, or the Lilium mackliniae, recognised as the state flower of Manipur, the other major festival is named after the Sangai, or the Manipur brow-antlered deer, recognised as its state animal. ‚Äî The Shirui Lily festival coincides with the blooming season of this rare flower. Held in Manipur‚Äôs Ukhrul district, which is home to the Tangkhul Naga community, the event is designed as an eco-tourism festival to raise awareness about the Shirui Lily and to promote tourism to the hills of Ukhrul. ‚Äî The Shirui Lily is endemic to the upper reaches of the Shirui Hill range in Ukhrul district at an elevation of 2,673 m above sea level. While locals had long been familiar with the plant ‚Äî calling it the ‚ÄòKashsong Timrawon‚Äô after Timrawon, the daughter of mythical goddess Philava who resides and protects the hills of Shirui ‚Äî in 1946, botanist Frank Kingdon-Ward identified it and gave it its scientific name. The name, Lilium mackliniae, draws from his wife Jean Macklin‚Äôs name. ‚Äî Over the years, this already endangered species has faced further threats to its habitat. Do You Know: ‚Äî The five-day-long Yaoshang festival, Manipur‚Äôs version of Holi, is celebrated every year on the full moon of Lamta (February-March) of the Meitei lunar calendar. ‚Äî Yaoshang begins just after sunset followed by Yaosang Mei thaba, also known as Burning of the Straw Hut. Children visit neighbours to ask for monetary donations, called nakatheng. ‚Äî Yaoshang, unlike Holi, is celebrated with a traditional twist in Manipur. During these five days Manipur comes alive with sporting events during the day and traditional ‚Äúthabal chongba‚Äù dance in the night. ‚Äî The thabal chongba is a traditional dance of the Meitei, where boys and girls gathered in an open ground and dance in a circle. But these days thabal chongba is performed throughout the month of Lamta.

Usually, the choice of the mode of transport is driven by convenience, comfort, and cost. But things are changing around the world for a completely different reason. There is growing interest in what experts call a ‚Äúmodal shift‚Äù ‚Äî moving people and goods from roads and flights to railways ‚Äî that could have a big impact on the environment, traffic, and even the economy. Key Points to Ponder: ‚Äî What is the contribution of road transport to the emission of greenhouse gases? ‚Äî What are the major greenhouse gases emitted by road transport? ‚Äî Understand the pros and cons of road transport and rail transport ‚Äî What is the national rail plan? ‚Äî What is a carbon credit? ‚Äî How can rail transport help in reducing carbon emissions? ‚Äî A modal shift from road to rail is crucial for India, which is one of the world‚Äôs largest GHG emitters. Analyse. Key Takeaways: ‚Äî This matters because cars, buses, and trucks are significant sources of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHG) that cause global warming. In fact, transport causes nearly a quarter of the world‚Äôs energy-related carbon emissions. ‚Äî Road transport is the biggest culprit, whereas rains are much cleaner. For example, trains produce only about 19 grams of carbon dioxide for each passenger per kilometre ‚Äî compared to 63 grams for buses, 123 grams for aeroplanes, and 148 grams for cars. Freight carried by train is also much more efficient. ‚Äî Despite the environmental benefits, rail use is going down worldwide. Between 2007 and 2021, the share of freight moved by train fell from 51 per cent to 40 per cent globally. For passengers, the share dropped from 12 per cent to 8 per cent. ‚Äî This loss is mainly because road transport is growing fast, especially in countries like India and China. If this trend continues, emissions from the transport sector in lower-income countries could cause a 16 per cent rise in GHG emissions. ‚Äî The European Union is setting an example with policies to move freight from roads to rail or ships. It aims to shift 30 per cent of road freight to rail or ship transport by 2030 and over 50 per cent by 2050. China is trying to shift freight transport to rail and has already seen less road traffic and a cleaner environment as a result. ‚Äî India has one of the largestrailway networksin the world, and many people and goods already travel by train. However, the shift toward road transport is also happening here because improvements in infrastructure have made it easier to travel by road. ‚Äî The National Rail Plan aims to boost the freight modal share of railways to 45 per cent by 2030 with significant investments in Dedicated Freight Corridors. A similar plan is needed to increase the passenger modal share of rail. ‚Äî The Delhi Metro alone is claimed to have removed over five lakh vehicles from the road daily in 2021, cutting CO2 emissions by at least 23.82 grams per km traveled. InMumbai, the metro and monorail modal share is projected to rise from 2 per cent to 36 per cent, reducing motor vehicle use from 35 per cent to 24 per cent. ‚Äî A modal shift from road to rail is crucial for India, which is one of the world‚Äôs largest GHG emitters, with 14 per cent coming from the transport sector alone. India plans to attain net zero status by 2070, which will require drastic cuts in GHG emissions from all sectors, including transport. ‚Äî India can also earn carbon credits by proving that the modal shift is reducing emissions through more rail use. These credits can be sold internationally to help fund more green projects. ‚Äî Shifting transportation from roads to rail is not just about trains but about building a cleaner, safer, and sustainable future. India has a huge opportunity to lead this change, reducing emissions while boosting its economy and improving daily life. Do You Know: ‚Äî Carbon dioxide emissions from India‚Äôs transport sector could be reduced up to 71 per cent by 2050 if high-ambition strategies are adopted on three key parameters ‚Äì electrification, improving fuel economy standards, and switching to cleaner modes of transport and mobility, said a new study by World Resources Institute (WRI) India. ‚Äî The transport sector accounted for 14 per cent of total energy-related CO2 emissions in 2020, 90 per cent of which was driven by road transport, which remains the most carbon-intensive. ‚Äî Out of this 90 per cent, two-wheelers contributed about 16 per cent, cars about 25 per cent, buses 9 per cent, freight light-duty vehicles (LDVs) 8 per cent, and freight heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) 45 per cent (the highest).

Key Points to Ponder: ‚Äî What is India‚Äôs nuclear program? ‚Äî What are Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors? ‚Äî Which was India‚Äôs first research reactor? ‚Äî What is the status of India‚Äôs nuclear program? ‚Äî What is the contribution of M R Srinivasan to India‚Äôs Nuclear program? Key Takeaways: ‚Äî Among the first generation of nuclear technologists in India, Srinivasan was one of the key people who built the country‚Äôs nuclear power programme. ‚Äî Joining the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1955 at the age of 25, Srinivasan rose to become its Chairman in 1987 and also headed the AEC. A mechanical engineer, his most important contribution was in the refinement and adaptation of Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors, which went on to become the backbone of nuclear power in India. ‚Äî Srinivasan was part of the team that built Apsara, India‚Äôs first research reactor in the 1950s, and was involved with every nuclear power plant built thereafter. ‚Äî Srinivasan had become the head of the Nuclear Energy Board in 1984. The Board managed and operated all nuclear power plants before it was transformed into the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) in 1987. Srinivasan was the obvious choice for the position of its founder-director. ‚Äî ‚ÄúPicked by Homi Bhabha himself, he played a pivotal role in the setting up of India‚Äôs very first nuclear power plant at Tarapur in the late 60s. Later he led the team that established India‚Äôs extensive nuclear power complex at Kalpakkam.‚Äù Do You Know: Three-stage nuclear programme ‚Üí STAGE 1: Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) use natural uranium-based fuels to generate electricity, while producing fissile plutonium (Pu239), which can be extracted by reprocessing the spent fuel. It uses heavy water (deuterium oxide) both as a coolant and moderator. The programme has been supplemented by the construction of imported Light Water Reactors (LWRs). ‚Üí STAGE 2: It involves setting up Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) of the kind atKalpakkam, using plutonium-based fuels, which can enhance nuclear power capacity, and convert fertile thorium into fissile uranium (U233). Reprocessing of the spent fuel is vital for efficient utilisation of the plutonium inventory. ‚Üí STAGE 3: Thethird stagewill be based on the ThU233 cycle. U233 produced in the second stage can be used for the third stage of the power programme, which consists of advanced thermal and fast breeder reactors, for long-term energy security. The Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) is proposed for this. Now, the use of molten salt reactors is also seen as an option.

What‚Äôs the ongoing story:Stating that agriculture is important ‚Äúnot only for growth, but also inclusive growth‚Äù, NITI Aayog member Prof Ramesh Chand Tuesday said growth in the farm sector was more impactful in reducing poverty than manufacturing. Key Points to Ponder: ‚Äî What do you understand by inclusive growth? ‚Äî How do you define poverty? ‚Äî What are the poverty alleviation programme in India? ‚Äî What is the potential of agriculture in bringing inclusive growth? Key Takeaways: ‚Äî ‚ÄúThere are studies which show the power of 1% growth in agriculture to reduce poverty is four times the power of manufacturing to reduce poverty,‚Äù Chand said at a symposium on ‚ÄòInnovation and Sustainability in India‚Äôs Root and Tuber Crop Sector‚Äô. ‚Äî Emphasising ‚Äòagriculture focused inclusive development‚Äô, he said, ‚ÄúI prepared a case for agriculture focused inclusive development, that agriculture is important, not only for growth, but also important for inclusive growth.‚Äù ‚Äî The symposium was organised by the Peru-based International Potato Center (CIP) in collaboration with the Central Potato Research Institute (CPRI), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). It was held as part of the CIP‚Äôs board meeting. ‚Äî The CIP, which commenced its work in India in 1975, plans to establish its South Asia Regional Centre at Singana in Agra, one of the top potato producing districts of the country ‚Äî India is today the second largest producer of potato in the world, and perhaps it will be the largest in near future. That‚Äôs an excellent foundation for future growth,‚Äù Heck added. ‚Äî With production of 93 million metric tonnes, China tops potato production globally followed by India (60 million metric tonnes). In a statement, the CIP said India is on course to overtake China in potato production Do You Know: ‚Äî Ram Singh writes: Inclusive growth is critical for us to become a developed nation by 2047. A leading indicator is improvements in the living standards of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid. Another is the direction of changes in income inequality. ‚Äî Apart from being a moral issue, distribution of national income determines the composition of aggregate demand and hence, the allocation of resources to different production processes, which, in turn, will affect the pace towards Viksit Bharat. ‚Äî In 1971, V N Dandekar and N Rath defined thepoverty linebased on calorie consumption (2,250 calories per person per day, based on National Sample Survey data of 1960-61), setting it at Rs 15 for rural and Rs 22.5 for urban areas. ‚Äî In 1979, the Y K Alagh Task Force set poverty lines based on calorie needs of 2,400 calories (rural) and 2,100 calories (urban), which remained the official method until the 1990s. However, this methodology for estimating poverty at the national and state levels has been critiqued by many for giving an inappropriate picture of poverty in the country. ‚Äî In 1989, the Planning Commission formed the Lakdawala Expert Group to ‚Äúlook into the methodology of estimating poverty and to redefine the poverty line, if necessary‚Äù. The Lakdawala Committee in 1993 introduced state-specific poverty lines, adjusting for regional price differences, but faced criticism for not maintaining the original calorie norms. ‚Äî In 2009, the Tendulkar Committee submitted its report of estimated poverty lines for rural and urban areas in all states. It concluded that the all India poverty line in 2004-05 was Rs 446.68 and Rs 578.80 per capita per month in rural and urban areas respectively.

What‚Äôs the ongoing story: Harsh Vardhan Agarwal writes:The India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) marks not just a high point in India‚Äôs trade negotiations but a transformative opportunity for Indian industry. It is a signpost of India‚Äôs maturing global presence ‚Äî no longer content to participate in trade from the sidelines, but ready to lead, partner and shape the next wave of global economic growth. Key Points to Ponder: ‚Äî Learn about the India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) ‚Äî What is the significance of FTA? ‚Äî What is zero-duty? ‚Äî What is the India-UK Double Contribution Convention? ‚Äî Which sectors will be impacted by the India-UK FTA? ‚Äî What is the status of India-EU and India-USA FTA? ‚Äî What is the difference between FTA and the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)? Key Takeaways: ‚Äî Historically, Indian exporters ‚Äî particularly in sectors like textiles, apparel, marine products, leather, and toys ‚Äî have been at a tariff disadvantage in developed markets like the UK. That changes now. With zero-duty access for nearly 99 per cent of Indian tariff lines, Indian firms finally enjoy a level playing field against competitors from the EU, Bangladesh and CPTPP countries. ‚Äî India‚Äôs approach to the FTA reflects a calibrated strategy. While offering duty-free access to 85 per cent of UK products over a phased 10-year period, India has protected sensitive sectors such as dairy, apples, edible oils, smartphones and medical devices. ‚Äî This balance of openness with strategic autonomy ensures Make in India and employment-intensive sectors are not disrupted. This should serve as a blueprint for future trade deals. ‚Äî The FTA‚Äôs most ambitious provisions lie in the services sector, a domain where India has a global edge‚Ä¶ The landmark Double Contribution Convention, which waives UK social security contributions for Indian professionals on temporary assignments, is not just a cost-saving tool. It will make Indian service exports even more competitive. ‚Äî The FTA provides a platform for deep bilateral cooperation in investment, innovation, and research. With the UK‚Äôs strength in design, R&D and advanced manufacturing, and India‚Äôs strength in scale, talent, and execution, this agreement paves the way for joint IP creation, technology transfer, and co-manufacturing. ‚Äî For the first time, an Indian FTA includes chapters on labour rights, environmental protection, consumer welfare, gender equity and anti-corruption. ‚Äî India‚Äôs long-term economic vision ‚Äî Viksit Bharat ‚Äî demands that we expand our share of global trade, move up the value chain, and create large-scale employment. The India-UK FTA is a major leap toward that vision. Do You Know: ‚Äî The Ministry of Commerce said in an FAQ that ‚ÄúFTAs are arrangements between two or more countries or trading blocs that primarily agree to reduce or eliminate customs tariff and non tariff barriers on substantial trade between them.‚Äù They can cover both goods and services. ‚Äî The UK‚Äôs Department of International Trade noted, ‚ÄúTrade and investment barriers can make it more difficult and costly to trade or invest overseas. By removing or reducing them, FTAs can make it easier for businesses to export, import and invest. They can also benefit consumers by providing a more diverse and affordable range of imported products.‚Äù ‚Äî Total UK exports to India amounted to ¬£17.1 billion, while total UK imports from India amounted to ¬£25.5 billion in 2024. India was Britain‚Äôs 11th-largest trading partner last year.

Mission Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning movie review: Tom Cruise‚Äôs last rodeo as Ethan Hunt makes a feeble appeal for a united world,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-movie-review-tom-cruise-last-rodeo-as-ethan-hunt-10012148/,"Did someone switch a few vowels, maybe? In a film where so many are talking so much, that won‚Äôt be entirely, well, impossible. For, this eighth and last (or so they say) film in the M:I franchise could as easily have been called Mission: Impassable, given its tortuous course. The Final Reckoning, of course, is the second half of what began as Part I in 2023. Five hours and 31 minutes later (making the two Final Reckonings the longest films in the franchise), you are still trying to care enough about the villain to hate it. And given that you have arguably the biggest movie star in the world on the other side, that should not be so hard. Tom Cruise is still out there giving it his all ‚Äì and yes, doing his own stunts ‚Äì kicking butt, dodging bullets, diving off submarines, dangling now not from one but two planes, almost dying not once but twice. Also read ‚ÄìMission Impossible Fallout review: The best Mission Impossible movie yet Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie spares no expense, taking the story from London underground to the Arctic Circle, Virginia‚Äôs Emergency Command Centre to South Africa‚Äôs Doomsday Vault, and some other stops in the middle. But, it must be asked, why exactly. The chase remains ‚Äì like in Part I ‚Äì of an Artificial Intelligence software gone rogue and dubbed the Entity, which is apparently trying to destroy the world (Ethan Hunt, that is Cruise, must take the President‚Äôs word for it, which is surely not a good starting point in a world where tech lies in bed with power). Surely, a simpler investment would be someone to write a counter code. But that would not leave Ethan much to do, would it? Particularly as the brains in that department are his two loyal sidekicks returning for the job, Luther (Rhames) and Benji (Pegg). Also returning is Grace (Atwell), whose pickpocketing skills that we saw in Part I are the best resource in a world running out of time. So this time, Ethan‚Äôs mission is retrieving some sort of a device from a Russian submarine that crashed somewhere in the ocean bed sometime in 2012. When a poison pill developed by Luther is plugged into it, Entity would be poof! If only someone would say poof! If it‚Äôs not complicated enough that Entity has brought the world to the brink of a nuclear disaster (a lot of nuclear talk here), lots of men and ‚Äì hats off ‚Äì women hold whispered, urgent conversations throughout The Final Reckoning about ‚Äúcounter-acoustic devices‚Äù, ‚Äúprimordial digital ooze‚Äù, ‚Äúhyperbaric decompression chambers‚Äù, underwater pressure and what it does to a human body‚Ä¶ etc etc. And this is even before Cruise gets to the Russian submarine. The action inside that submarine, precariously balanced and one tip away from crashing, with water filling up and missiles floating about, dead bodies jumping up, and Ethan figuring out its many panels and chambers, is one of the most breathtaking sequences of The Final Reckoning. At the very least, it is something original in a franchise that seems to have run out of original ideas on what to put Ethan through ‚Äì though Cruise still makes running that fiercely and hanging mid-air that fearlessly look easy. The M:I score barely makes an appearance, and those famous masks get barely a peeling. Above all, The Final Reckoning is an ode to that Cruise, in its numerous flashbacks to the previous M:I films, underlining the times he saved the world, and just how jaw-droppingly, the sacrifices he made, the people he loved and lost. Read more ‚ÄìMission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One movie review: Tom Cruise delivers bang for the buck thrills And if McQuarrie, who with five films got the most out of this franchise after his lead actor, is not showing Cruise in action, he has people gushing about it. ‚ÄúThe world would be a very different place without you, or not there at all,‚Äù is one such praise, followed by many different versions of the same. People can‚Äôt help praising Ethan even seconds away from the explosion of megatons of detonators. Ethan is supposed to be doubting his contribution, in terms of gains versus loss, and The Final Reckoning makes a feeble appeal for a united world, not divided by nationalities, more than once. That is, till the world is brought to the brink again ‚Äì and saved. But hey, Cruise remains one of the best people to do that still. He just needs a better world than The Final Reckoning‚Äôs to save. Long time back, in M:I II, Anthony Hopkins‚Äôs character tells Ethan: ‚ÄúNow, it‚Äôs not Mission Difficult is it‚Ä¶ Difficult would be a walk in the park for you.‚Äù So, we‚Äôll wait for a new mission ‚Äì should Cruise choose to accept it.

How an AI-generated summer reading list exposed a crisis in journalism,https://indianexpress.com/article/books-and-literature/ai-generated-the-chicago-sun-times-summer-reading-list-crisis-journalism-10022464/,"A summer reading list for 2025, published in a few US-based newspapers, has become a cautionary tale for journalism and publishing industries in the era of artificial intelligence, portending a crisis of credibility. The Hearst Newspapers-owned content syndication service, King Features, had curated and circulated the reading list in question, which appeared in several prominent regional outlets, including The Chicago Sun-Times and at least one edition of The Philadelphia Inquirer. The catch? Most of the books didn‚Äôt exist, and some were falsely attributed to celebrated authors. The listicle recommended 15 books, of which only five were real‚Äîthe remainder were AI hallucinations. The article, ‚ÄòThe heat index: your guide to the best of summer‚Äô listing non-existent books appeared in a special section of the Chicago Sun-Times May 18 (Sunday) edition. Among the fabricated titles were Tidewater Dreams that was touted as Chilean American novelist Isabel Allende‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst climate fiction novel,‚Äù and The Rainmakers, described as a futuristic novel on water scarcity wrongly attributed to Pulitzer Prize-winner Percival Everett.

In a statement to NPR, Buscaglia took full responsibility: ‚ÄúHuge mistake on my part and has nothing to do with the¬†Sun-Times. They trust that the content they purchase is accurate and I betrayed that trust. It‚Äôs on me 100 percent.‚Äù In a formal response, the Sun-Times said: ‚ÄúTo our great disappointment, that list was created through the use of an AI tool and recommended books that do not exist,‚Äù the paper said. ‚ÄúWe are actively investigating the accuracy of other content in the special section.‚Äù While the Sun-Times prides itself on being ‚Äúdeeply focused on telling the stories of this city,‚Äù the paper acknowledged that it supplements local journalism with syndicated content from partners such as King Features. According to their statement, the AI-generated list entered print without editorial review or disclosure of its third-party origin. King Features, for its part, confirmed that the freelance contributor violated its AI policy. ‚ÄúWe are terminating our relationship with this individual,‚Äù the syndicate said. ‚ÄúWe regret this incident and are working with the handful of publishing partners who acquired this supplement.‚Äù The incident comes at a particularly precarious moment for the Sun-Times, which announced earlier this year that 20% of its staff had accepted buyouts amidst ongoing financial strain. As newsroom resources shrink, publishers increasingly lean on syndicated materials ‚Äî a trend that has made room for AI-generated fillers to slip through the cracks. ‚ÄúThis should be a learning moment for all journalism organisations,‚Äù the Sun-Times wrote. ‚ÄúOur work is valued ‚Äî and valuable ‚Äî because of the humanity behind it.‚Äù The backlash among readers and book professionals was immediate.

"OpinionTrump, black and white",https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/trump-black-and-white-10022887/,"Chief among the many differences between diplomacy and reality TV is that the latter is built on ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù moments and catchphrases. That the two can now be spoken of in the same breath speaks to the disruption of, and disregard for, the norms of diplomacy-as-usual by US President Donald Trump. Less than three months after he all but upended Washington‚Äôs stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict in a public spat with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, Trump tried to ambush South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with footage of questionable provenance ‚Äî the four-minute video showed out-of-context clips of protestors and symbols. Trump, who has accused the South African government of aiding ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù, all but treated a visiting head of state as a contestant on The Apprentice. This diplomacy that sees summit-level meetings as an opportunity to score political points, and for posturing to a domestic base, has implications beyond the optics of the current moment. South Africa is indeed suffering from a crime wave. However, as data have shown, victims are overwhelmingly Black. When asked politely by Ramaphosa, Trump was unable to pinpoint exactly where and when the incidents in the video took place. In fact, he repeated the tropes of far-right conspiracy theorists, who have, without evidence, claimed mass killings of White South Africans and ignored the challenges of emerging from decades of colonialism and Apartheid. The attack on Ramaphosa is of a piece with the performative diplomacy of the current administration. In February 2025, Vice President J D Vance attacked the politics of America‚Äôs closest allies in Europe at the Munich Conference. This crossing of diplomatic red lines and frequent weaponisation of forums could undermine the rules of engagement between countries. It also makes the behind-the-scenes compromises that are a large part of the stuff of diplomacy more difficult. The South African President tried to defuse the situation with a joke: ‚ÄúI am sorry I don‚Äôt have a plane to give you,‚Äù alluding to the recent gift by Qatar to the US. Ramaphosa‚Äôs conduct could provide a pointer on how to react when the leader of the world‚Äôs pre-eminent superpower tries to turn a routine briefing into ‚Äúgood TV‚Äù. This might be the way forward for leaders as they make their way in a world upended by the current administration in the US."

Suryakumar Yadav‚Äôs 73-run knock against Delhi: A throwback to pre-360 degree life,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/ipl/suryakumar-yadav-73-delhi-capitals-ipl-2025-throwback-pre-360-degree-10022763/,"The first beam of light fromSuryakumar Yadav‚Äôsbat to the third-man fence flashed in the penultimate ball of Mumbai Indians innings. The 42nd ball he facedagainst Delhi Capitals, he crouched and dabbed a wide yorker past the wicket-keeper to the sprawling real estate between third man and fine-leg where T20 batting‚Äôs greatest field-space-time manipulator, in the post AB-era, finds a bulk of his runs. It took his most familiar boundary route to realise that he had taken the most unfamiliar path to travel this far. Then, the innings, an outlier in his album of improvised destructibility, captured his firm grounding in the pre-modern times, a throwback to the pre-360-degree life of Suryakumar. Before SKY, there existed Surya. He burst forth as a proper red-ball cricketer inMumbaileagues in the late aughts, when playing straight and scoring big fetched the greatest rewards in the game, when T20 cricket had not yet transformed the geography of batting and initiated the era of disruptive shot innovation. He made his first-class debut in 2010, and eight long years would pass before he fully evolved into a T20 giant. He was not so much of a 360-degree exponent as a classical stroke-maker. This innings of methodical aggression was SKY‚Äôs ode to Surya, punctuating his brilliance at hitting in the orthodox V, and finding the conventional pockets of gap, but still hitting at a strike rate of 170, still confounding bowlers and still winning games. Sizing up the surface, sluggish and where the odd ball gripped and spat, he blindfolded himself to the temptations behind the wicket-keeper, the one-handed frolics and one-legged pirouetting were set apart for quicker decks, and harnessed all his energy to threading the ball through the gaps in front of him, often with brute force and bottom-handed savagery. Against the wrist-spin duet ofKuldeep Yadavand Vipraj Nigam who found bite from the surface, he turned ascetic. Apart from a cut when Kuldeep erred on the shorter side, he was content sneaking singles and twos. The innings was Dhoni-like in rendition. Gritting out and hanging on, punishing the loose balls, and going berserk in the endgame. At one stage, he was 22 off 21 balls; the next 22 earned him 51. Intermittently, he opened his stance, wandered in the crease, threatened to scoop and ramp, but those were all theatrics to distract bowlers and force them to bowl fuller at him, his safest zone for him to uncork the most productive shots on the surface. The fundamentals were pegged around the same basic movement, opening out his front foot to create that power-hitting base, the eyes and head still, limbs balanced and his mind processing a picture of the angles and spaces in the field, recalibrated minutely as the ball entered his arc. The same elastic wrists that guide and glide the ball past the fielders behind him attain a sudden fury. His first six off the night captured the essence. He danced down the track to Mustafizur Rahman‚Äôs slower ball and clumped it over his head, a flat and furious swipe, similar toAB de Villiers‚Äô hits on similarly slow surfaces where he can harness the bowler‚Äôs pace. When there is no impetus on the ball, Surya, like AB, generates their own momentum with strong shoulders and a stable lower body. Rarely was Suryakumar spotted off-balance when he imparted incredible power into his strokes. All four of his sixes were struck in the arch between extra cover and mid-wicket. The most incredible was a thump through extra cover off Mukesh Kumar‚Äôs 19th over. Mukesh had erred on the fuller side outside the off-stump, Suryakumar just stretched his hands, the knees flexed and swung the ball over the fence. The moment the bowlers offered him a hint of width, he smeared them through cover or extra cover. When they tried to compensate by bowling into the stumps, he cuffed them through mid-wicket and wide long-on. Balls of similar trajectories would have soared over the fine-leg fence on quicker surfaces. That is the all-encompassing mastery of Suryakumar. He is imaginative on belters, and prudent in difficult climes. The knock symbolised his season, where he had been prolific without being spectacular, less flashier, less round-the-park, but equally potent and destructive the driving force behind the renaissance. He has stealthily climbed to the third spot on theorange cappile, his 583 runs coming at a strike rate of 170.46. Among the top-10 this season, only Prabhsimran Singh has a better hitting rate (171). Not that he has entirely stopped hitting behind the stumps, but he has become wiser in changing his approach according to the nature of the pitch. Every batsman tries to, but in the relentless T20 churn, some fail to revise their methods, trapped in their own image. Perhaps, the eye-opener was the relative slump preluding the league. His last eight T20 innings for the country had fetched him only 54 runs. Premature and exaggerated talks of waning reflexes did the rounds. The way out of the rut was in his own game, waiting to be discovered. So he turned the clock back, reacquainted with the Surya of maidans and rediscovered the runs and boundaries. So he adopted a more traditional approach, the zenith being the 73 not out againstDC. ‚ÄúThis is one innings which I was hoping for a long time: a difficult situation, to bat through to the end. It was a slightly slow wicket with the weather around. We wanted to take it deep, talked about that during the practice sessions, planned for it and batted accordingly,‚Äù he explained to the host broadcasters during the innings break. But the 360-degree avatar would not be far behind, waiting to resurface and consume helpless fast bowlers in its raging flames.

"Ahead of WWDC: How Swiggy, LightX, and others are tapping into Apple Intelligence framework",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/how-swiggy-lightx-tapping-into-apple-ai-wwdc-10022560/,"Apple‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference:Widely perceived as having fallen behind in the high-stakes AI race, Apple is expected to make a renewed bid to catch up with competitors at its annualWorldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)slated from June 9 to June 13. The iPhone-maker‚Äôs AI reboot will include letting third-party developers build on top of its smaller, in-house AI models, according to a report byBloomberg. The new framework will also let developers integrate its flagship AI offering,AppleIntelligence, across their apps. While Apple looks to ramp up its long-term AI strategy to win over users, major Indian developers have said that they are already collaborating with the tech giant to integrate existing Apple Intelligence features in the application layer. Online food delivery platformSwiggyhas said it relies on Apple‚Äôs machine learning-based Translation API that was announced iniOS18 last year. ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs in-app translations let you translate from English to any language without using any third-party libraries. So, for our food menu, which is very textual, we used Apple‚Äôs APIs to translate those text to Hindi language,‚Äù Agam Mahajan, iOS developer and engineering lead at Swiggy, toldindianexpress.comat a recent virtual developer showcase organised by Apple. Mahajan also revealed that Swiggy Instamart leveraged Apple‚Äôs Vision frameworks to develop its popular Shopping List feature that lets users upload their handwritten shopping lists to create a cart with those items on the app. Swiggy has also developed a new feature (in beta) around Apple‚Äôs Image Playground API. This feature lets users prompt for AI-generated images to be used as the profile picture for their accounts. ‚ÄúWe are also using Siri intents so that the search on Siri can be more personalised to the end consumer,‚Äù Mahajan said. Beyond e-commerce, Apple is also enabling Indian developers to roll out AI-focused content creation tools. LightX is one such graphic design and image editing app developed by Noida-based AndOr Communications. ‚ÄúWe currently have7.55 million downloads globallyand we have a 4.7 rating based on 1,38,000 users‚Äô experiences,‚Äù said Sharad Shankar, the founder and CEO of AndOr Communications. In 2024, India emerged as the largest market for AI app downloads, contributing 21 per cent of total downloads globally, according to data provided by SensorTower. Eight out of the ten highest grossing graphic design apps on the App Store in India have AI in the name, which is indicative of the surging popularity of AI-based creative apps. ‚ÄúWhen we started our company around December 2015 as AndOr, we realised that smartphones are getting more and more powerful, and we wanted to build something similar to Photoshop. We also realised that people are going to create more content through their smartphones. That is why we developed LightX,‚Äù Shankar, an IIT Kanpur graduate, told indianexpress.com. LightX provides users with a suite of tools for graphic design as well as photo and video editing. When it was first rolled out, LightX was a paid app that was priced differently in different territories. It saw nearly 1.2 million downloads and with a 4.7 rating, LightX was ranked at the 16th spot in the App Store in the US and at the 17th spot in a few European countries as well. However, the company has since pivoted to a subscription-based business model as it was no longer ‚Äúfinancially viable for us to keep building features just for $3 or so,‚Äù Shankar said. It has also moved beyond offering common photo editing tasks like crop, resize, image cleanup, and touch-up. ‚ÄúWe have started investing more and more energy towards building AI tools. We now have a suite of AI offerings where users can take a picture of a person, change the outfit or hairstyle of the person, and even create a professional-looking headshot,‚Äù Shankar said, adding that users can also createAI-generated, Ghibli style animated imagesand cartoon caricatures using the app. It is also working on a semantic photo editor, where users can dictate changes to photos. Its graphic design solutions have also been revamped to be more AI-oriented, providing AI-generated birthday cards, for example. Citing the high cost of building foundational models, Shankar revealed that LightX is built on top of open-source AI models like Stability Diffusion whose outputs are fine tuned based on user requirements. He added that LightX utilises Apple‚Äôs core graphics engine and vision libraries in order to enhance its creative AI features by detecting faces, recognising poses, and removing the background from images. The App Store has also been a great facilitator for us, Shankar said, especially when it comes to featuring us for different events like Holi and Diwali in India. In terms of guardrails, LightX has a backend filter which disallows any kind of NSFW content. ‚ÄúIf there is any amount of nudity that we find in photos, we completely block it and we relay an error message. That is kind of very strict because we have constant guidelines from Apple as well asGoogle. They don‚Äôt allow you to generate such content,‚Äù Shankar said. When asked if the AI-modified images on LightX carry any labels, invisible watermarks, or hidden identifiers in the metadata, Shankar said that they would be happy to undertake such provenance efforts if there was some kind of regulation that demanded it.
